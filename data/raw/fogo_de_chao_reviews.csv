"I came here this passed Sunday for brunch. We had a reservation for 11:30 and they started letting people in at 11:28 approximately. They also sat us at 11:40 I think or so. I was concerned if we would have enough time because brunch ends at 2:00 p.m. I was wrong we had more than enough time and I loved this brunch. When we were seated everything was fresh and ready. They started with the rotating meats. Our waiter was very friendly and informative. They have all day happy hour and I had two drinks. The buffet has everything you could imagine, rice and beans along with soup. I had the rice and beans. Then I had different salads and fruits. The fruits were delicious and fresh. The buffet area was immaculately clean. I also had vanilla parfait which was good. The meats were very good and it was hot. I am concerned with the temperature of the foods in buffets. I am happy to say all the food was at the correct temperature. The salads and fruits were cold and fresh. The meat and hot items were hot and fresh as well. There was a good amount of variety in the meat selection. They would ask what type of temperature do you and for the meat. I liked that because everyone has a preference. I also loved the sides which they gave us the polenta fries were my favorite and the mashed potatoes were also delicious. They have delicious hot sauce and a green sauce.There were a couple of items which I did not enjoy the lamb, the pork Parmesan and chicken wrapped in bacon. The chicken wrapped in bacon, the chicken was dry. The Parmesan pork, was a bit dry and the coating of the Parmesan on the pork did not work for me. The lamb was not flavorful. The place is quite beautiful and perfect place for a gathering or dinner. The place has a lot of lighting which I like. My favorite part is no one rushed us which was great. Someone came to check on us and asked us if we were enjoying the restaurant. Everyone works as a team, and it shows because various people would help us when we asked for something. I am looking forward to going back.",5.0,"Jan 31, 2024"
"I came here last night and I must say I was unsure of what to expect due to all the negative reviews. But I was pleasantly surprised. Now we went to the launch party which means we did not eat the buffet. So my review is about the appetizers, drinks and bar area upstairs. So the food, was good and most of it was fresh and well seasoned. When we came in we were given champagne which was very good and they had two tables filled with shrimp cocktail, cheese bread, charcuterie board and artichoke and spinach dip. This was a very nice spread which was very fresh. Then they also had waiters with appetizers and this was also delicious. They had lamb chops which were really well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The lamb chops were juicy. Also the beef empanadas were also very good. They had shrimp and lobster lettuce wraps. This was very good as well but they said tacos. To me a taco is not a lettuce wrap. That's just my opinion but it was also very fresh and had the right balance. What I did not like the way they make chicken. They had chicken sliders they were dry and even when I added the sauce it was dry. They had pierces of chicken, the same thing it looked dry. Then they wings and those were perfect. The wings had a bbq sauce and they were coated in the sauce and it was absolutely delicious. So my recommendation is use that recipe for the chicken in the sliders. Now the grilled cheese was delicious and we ate so much of it.The service was amazing the staff asked if you needed anything and were very friendly. The bartender Sarah  was awesome very friendly and her drinks were perfect. Also Andrea was so nice as well making sure we had everything we needed. Overall I would definitely recommend this place and come back for the hh. They have drink specials and food hh.",4.0,"Apr 8, 2022"
"- super large venue- they have it down to a science where everything is refilled on time, the meats are coming sporadically (not as consistent as we wanted), and the staff are well rehearsed- took 20 minutes to sit down; they told us to ""go to the bar,"" but then after 20 minutes we checked with them and they said they called us out loud but since we were at the bar, we didn't hear them- filet mignon was my favorite, but took until the very end to come by- the cheese bread is insanely good- chicken drumsticks; wish they had wings- the sausage was excellent- martini and alcoholic drinks were well made and mixedOverall, professional staff, good quality food, and clean. It was very busy, and the meat flow was slower, but would come again.",4.0,"Dec 8, 2023"
"We made a reservation for thanksgiving at 5:45 and walked in right before, the place was packed and they made us wait for over an hour, we did not get seated until 7pm The meat service was so slow and we didn't get to try the things we really wanted to. The service was slow, too. It took them an additional thirty minutes to bring our check I received an email for a complimentary dessert and when I ordered it, I still got charged for it. So what was the point? Not worth the 100+ per person Overall 3/10",1.0,"Nov 24, 2023"

"This was my first time visiting the Manhattan Fogo De Chao location. This location is beautiful and huge. There are multiple floors. I was seated on the lower level. The staff were very attentive and they provided excellent customer service. For my meal, I had the Churrasco Experience which consisted of different signature cuts of fire roasted meats. I had the pork sausage, pork belly, chicken wrapped with bacon, chicken leg, filet mignon and sirloin steak. Everything was well prepared and delicious. I went to the Market Table and Feijoada Bar and I took advantage of the different varieties of salads. I had the white rice with beans, potato salad, chicken salad, corn salad, Caesar salad and tomatoes. I enjoyed my meal and drinks. I ordered two drinks the Cucumber Mint Smash and Passionate Caipirinha. The drinks were very tasty. I was stuffed and very satisfied. I'll definitely come back to this location in the future. Great experience!",4.0,"Feb 13, 2024"
"Snow day in NYC was a good excuse to skip breakfast and go right to lunch. And when I say lunch this probably will be your only meal for the day. Here's the set up. You wait to be seated at a cavernous space downstairs across MOMA, at an emporium of meat. Yes there is a full salad buffet and some additional classic hot dishes like feijoada, but you're here for the meat. Lunch is $50 AYCE. Drinks and dessert is not included. For that $, you get unlimited selections of churrasco meats, which are constantly brought out in a steady procession. You need to pace yourself through various parts of chicken, drumsticks  and breast wrapped in bacon. If you're waiting for the beef, you will also be tempted by pork chops and also lamb. Assuming you waited patiently, the beef lover in you will rejoice in multiple different cuts from classic filet mignon to picanha all served to your liking from rare to well done. Naturally all the meat also comes with side dishes of mashed garlic potatoes, fried polenta, fried banana and of course cheese bread or pao de queijo. No pressure to finish what you don't like and they will gladly swap your plate. I felt that the servers struggled a bit to keep the cuts thin enough as well as not too overcooked. The lighting is dim so that doesn't help when you want to get medium rare and waiter thinks it's well done.  All in with tax, soda , gratuity we paid around $140 for 2. To save some $$ , buy gift cards from Costco $100 for $80 to help offset the total. Would you come back frequently? Probably not but occasional meat sweats from this well established chain is worth the experience.",4.0,"Oct 28, 2023"
"So good!!Came here for the best of Brazil deal ($44) and it was amazing.Loved all the cuts of meat, especially the picanha and bottom sirloin. Didn't see any pork or lamb, but I prefer beef anyway so nbd. Might have to request for specific cuts since it sometimes takes a while for meats to get to you. Excellent service and great way to celebrate my birthday early!",4.0,"Oct 27, 2023"
"Huge steak house. The ambience is beautiful. The food was good, but it seemed that the meat quality wasn't great . We got the Churrasco  Experience . Some of the choices were good, some not at all. The Churrasco experience comes with buffet MARKET TABLE & FEIJOADA BAR, which had good selection of appetisers. We didn't like The detests  at all. The lava cake was super dry and ice cream felt like a regular supermarket ice cream. The service was ok as well. You are supposed to flip the sticker on the table to green side when you are ready for another piece of meat. I wish they were more attentive, as sometimes we had to call them, as they'd just pass by without getting to our table , although our stickers were with green side up .So overall we had good time, but should we return- no .",5.0,"Nov 2, 2023"
As you know I love Fogo but this is my first time visiting the one in Manhattan. This place is beautiful! This location has all day happy hour at the bar. Score! Lol the decor blows u away as soon as your walking downstairs to your table. The salad bar never disappoints and the meats were cooked to perfection. My goal is to visit as many Fogos in as many locations as I can. If you have never experienced Fogo please do yourself a favor!!,4.0,"Oct 31, 2023"
"Came here with some friends after work for the all you can eat and it was a good experience. You can do the all you can eat option that gives you a select set of meats for a certain price or you can opt to get the more expensive cuts instead. There is a difference in quality of the cuts when it comes to the price as well. The servers come around with different meat options to choose from ranging from beef, lamb, pork and chicken. The lamb and beef were tender and cooked to perfection. They have an upstairs and downstairs section hood for large groups. My only issue was that later on in the dinner service, it felt like the servers forgot about us. I guess they thought we were full. Overall a great bang for your buck!",5.0,"May 14, 2023"
"Been here last week after hearing many good things about this place. It was actually nice looking and very clean, the open salad bar was great and with a variety of offers, starters and dishes. The meats started arriving and most of them were pretty good. I didn't personally enjoy the Parmesan pork and one or two more, but the others were good (I know I'm being generic, but we ate so much it's hard to remember exactly what we got!). For meat lovers this is a great option. We asked for Coca-Cola, the first one was good. The second one, they tell us they only have Coca-Cola Zero. We ask for two, then an other server asks us if we want to drink something, we say that we already asked for two cocacolas, they bring the zeros after 15 minutes, and two minutes later the second server bring us the regular ""draft"" ones (so they actually had it!!) They change them and they were absolutely without gas  so sad. Well, at least they didn't charge us extra, but they were bad. Oh, and they poured tap water in our glasses that were full of bottled water, absolutely ruining the 8.25$ that a bottle of Acqua Panna costed us. Except this long waiting time, their miscommunication between waiters and the water issue, the food was good. I would come back :)",4.0,"Dec 23, 2023"
My first experience here was really great! Lots of meat varieties and you can ask them for a specific one and they'll call their staff over to serve you.

"If you have ever been to this Brazilian steakhouse, I would say it is even more worth it with their special $45 per person meal. Hands-down, one of the best experiences I've ever had, besides from the awestruck interior, the service and food quality were on par! Veggies and appetizers were very fresh. But don't make the mistake I made by getting full on these apps. The cuts of meat came to our table as long as we had our tags faced up to green (red means no more!). Meats were portioned out well with a lot of varieties. My friend does not eat pork but still trie a lot of different cuts. Best of all was their cheesy bread (not shown), which also comes as part of your all you can eat meal. On top of that, Service was top notch. I did not request a celebration for my birthday month, but they were kind enough to send a crème brûlée to our table which was, no surprise, fantastically smooth, not overly sweet, yet refreshing. Definitely would recommend! And try to make it for their special pricing if the deal hasn't ended!",5.0,"Oct 29, 2023"
"Went there for our anniversary. Extremely nice ambience. Waitress was very friendly, and we got seated immediately, She told us how the process worked and soon the waiters started coming up to us with different cuts of meat.The meat was very nice, although a bit unseasoned. We really enjoyed Garlic Chicken and the Pork Sausage. They try to give you these complimentary puff balls as appetizers but I do not recommend you eat any of it since it fills you up and you end up not eating as much meat.I ordered a Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream as a dessert and it was fantastic.TLDR: Very nice place, good selection of meats (needs more salt), friendly & professional staff, very nice dessert.",3.0,"Nov 11, 2023"
"This Brazilian steakhouse can be gluttonous fun, more if it's on a corporate dime, but no matter how much they charge (and it's a lot) it doesn't feel high end. Came here for a large birthday party. We were about 30 people and took up two tables. A party that size is forced to have a pre fix price per person, which is understandable, but we couldn't help noticing that smaller dining parties got a larger variety of meats that were brought more often. Additionally, the non meat eaters at our table, who had to pre order salmon, had to pay the same for the fish as those paying for unlimited steak. So while the whole place can be fun it sucks a little to feel like you're overpaying.",4.0,"Dec 24, 2022"

"bring your appetite because Fogo de Chao has the meats--plus so much more other food! Churrascaria (Brazilian bbq) is a feast of endless types of bbqed meats (about 13 different kinds from ribeye to bacon-wrapper chicken to ribs) that are sliced and served at your table by roving waiters and the experience is rounded out by a fantasy island of a salad bar (serve yourself). really enjoyed the Picanha (top sirloin), ribeye, and ribs--all the meats tasted high quality and were really well seasoned. and the salad bar is large and full of variety from fresh veggies to rice & beans to cheeses and so much more and is constantly refreshed. don't forget to order a caipirinha or two...anyway my main takeaways is the food options are high quality. the restaurant itself is gigantic--multiple floor of dining. the space has a classy feel without feeling snooty. the service is excellent and the staff works hard to make sure your meal goes well. ended up having a table on the top floor which was the smallest dining space so it was a little more intimate while still maintaining the energetic vibe of churrascaria. Fogo is definitely where you should bring your appetite and expect to have a fun night. great option when you have family and friends in town or looking for a different kind of dinner experience in NYC.",3.0,"Jan 1, 2023"
"Christmas Eve dinner was so unenjoyable we'd never consider going back, even with the gift-card I have in my wallet.Arriving at 3:35 for a 3:45 reservation will get you seated by about 4:30 apparently and being that it's such a big place, they cannot heat the rooms anywhere above ""super cold degrees""So while you stand for a half hour waiting for your table, reservation or not, you also get to be so cold you'll need to huddle together... yet they still ask people if they wanted to check their coats... imagine!?  I can't at all imagine not having my coat for that wait let alone once being sat at the table and still needing to bundle up.It was so cold that the food skewers wouldn't even be warm when cut and served table side.   I just wanted my mother to come have a decent time visiting me in the city on christmas; I really wouldn't have expected it to go that far south.  The salad bar is tiny but you'll be full in three seconds, no matter what you start grabbing- pro tip, save room for the meat, you're paying a lot for it.The lamb was phenomenal and hands down the best meat served while there.A few others were great and most everything was good but I'd expect to roll out the door at a place like this which wasn't the case, I ate a moderately small amount as I was just so uncomfortable and mad.The manager comped meals and made it right; they apologized and I understand it was a brutally cold night but I think they have a responsibility to keep everyone warm or say something beforehand.    Because they made it right, I'll keep the star rating three, but even if it was warm I think I'd prefer other similar places.",5.0,"Jul 9, 2023"

"So disappointing. Had  dinner  last night with friends at Fogo.  The food and service were subpar to say the least. The meat was not coming frequently as usual and the servings in the table; cheese bread, polenta and plantains were even more scarce - - - I had to keep asking them for water, drinks and extra servings. Last time we have an abundance of food coming to the table.  They didn't have half of the dessert options and took out the pudim (Brazilian fan)  from the menu as well.  I don't understand how this restaurant changed so drastically in 6 month from my last visit.Now they also have a cheaper version of the rodízio to attract more people which is fine but don't compromise the quality of the food and service for everyone. They are cutting corners to make more money. What didn't change was the price of my bill of course! Paid 460 dollars for 4 people.

"FANTASTIC! As a born and raised Brazilian from Porto Alegre City - - - the so called churrasco capital of my county, I was very impressed! We had the ""churrasco"" ( BBQ) and the quality of the meat was second to none. It was like we were eating in Brazil.  The side dishes tasted just like our home made food with all the authentic flavors. They also have a vast salad bar with top quality cheeses, cold cuts etc.  The venue itself is trendy and very spacious with a cool decor reminding the origins of this type of restaurant from the most southern State of Brazil. The service was very efficient and friendly - - - shout out to our waiter Paulo! Again, we loved this restaurant and will be coming back for sure but just be aware that it is not a cheap place. Having one drink and dessert you will dish about $150 per person.",4.0,"Aug 2, 2023"
"I went on a Tuesday night to celebrate my boyfriends cousins birthday! I had a really good time. The food and service was also really good! The place itself is gorgeous. When you get to your table they start you off with cheesy bread and drinks, I ordered a skinny Margarita. It was refreshing and had the perfect amount of lime. My boyfriend had the passion fruit caipirinha I found that to be too sweet for me. After that you get up and serve yourself from the market buffet. The caprese and Cesar salads were my favorite. They also had fruits, veggies, salami, dressings & so much more! After that the servers come around with the meats. It's so many kinds I couldn't even keep track of them. My favorites were the sirloin, filtet mignon, & churrasco. I asked for my meats to be medium well. I wasn't a fan of the lamb but others at my table seemed to enjoy it. They also give you sides of mash which is to die for, plantain & something like yuca fries. To end our meal we had dessert they brought us cheese cake, chocolate mousse cake, & key lime. The cheese cake was the star, the chocolate mousse was also good but the key lime pie was not the best it was like biting into a lime. Overall I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion as it is on the pricer side. The food is good and the service is truly excellent. The staff is really attentive and makes sure you're taken care of! Thank you Fogo de Chao!",5.0,"Jan 1, 2024"

You can see the cross section in Figure 2Perfect medium rare gravy locked insideAlmost everyone in the restaurant has this dish and the whole family must order it!The duck breast was also very tasty. The caramel and duck meat on the outer layer makes me feel that this duck's life has not been in vainThere were a lot of things on the menu that I wanted to order, but there were only two of us and we couldn't eat because we were already full, hahahahaLater we asked the waiter and found out that they had just opened less than a year ago.

"2nd time here. Service is good, food is good, drinks are great but some things cannot over look. Way too many people here. Can barely walk around. I'm sure it's over capacity on weekends. One salad bar for the entire place is ridiculous. Barely able to load plates at the salad bar as it is packed with 50 people at once. Need a second salad bar. Also Hundreds of people inside by front area waiting for a seat makes going to the bathroom while dining an ordeal. Not worth spending that much money and being uncomfortable the whole time.

"My boyfriend and I came here last minute for our anniversary.  The other restaurants were booked for a Saturday, and I had told him I came to another Fogo de Chao from a Yelp event and it blew me away.I didn't know how much it was, I expected it to be expensive but not as expensive as this.  He didn't mind paying and wanted to go.As soon as we get in you're taken aback by the atmosphere, and as you look down the staircase you're in aw.  The hostesses were great, seated us quickly (it was an earlier dinner, though).  Although by the time we left - the lobby was full - they should really get more seating.  Unless they do and it was just because the christmas tree was there.Anyway, our waitress was named Genesis.  She was one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She made our experience fantastic.  She offered us a light because it was so dark, super nice of her, when noticing nobody else got a light around. She asked if we were here for a special occasion and we had told her.So as the night goes on, we had a great dinner.  Dinner is EXPENSIVE.  $75 for unlimited meats, but the trick is they fill you up on umlimited mashed potatoes (which were amazing btw), yuka fries and plantains, along with the buffett ""salad"" (but more) bar.  He said their meats were fantastic.  I ordered the salmon cause I can't fathom spending $75 on a plate of food.  So we got pretty stuffed quickly, and as he asked for the check, Genesis gave us a cheesecake plate that wrote Happy Anniversary.  She made this dinner incredible and such a sweet lady. We were so grateful!The other staff as well were just so incredibly on point. I'm so suprised it's a chain restaurant with such great quality and quantity.",3.0,"Jan 8, 2024"

"Meat quality remains great although it does feel like they come around repeatedly with the same options. We've been to other locations but this one by far was the worse. The waiter messed up our drink order the first time. The second time he never brought the drink, and the third time we had to ask other waiters because we still hadn't received them. They also messed up the drinks, tasted very off, so we had to send them back. We had about 3 different people wait on us to the point where we didn't even know if our first waiter was still our server. He also brought out the sides (potatoes, polenta, plantains) after we turned our card red and were done eating. When we asked if we could pack a few of the leftover cheese puffs to go they said no and that we had to pay for them. Seemed like a tacky thing to do since they are complimentary and should be thrown out anyway of we didn't consume them.

"My favorite place for Brazilian bbq in midtown. Fogo de Chao is both a hardy choice and good for what you pay for. Location: Located right across from the Modern and not far from the MOMA, Fogo de Chao is in an easy to find location in Midtown. Food: We decided to go for the full service which includes salad bar and meat. The salad bar was well stocked and had a variety of cheeses, in addition to your traditional salads and dressings . Of course, though, the real star of our meals was the unending parade of meat that came to our table - everything was well cooked and tasted delicious. I also really liked the cheesy bread. Service: The service was really attentive, and we all were very satisfied with the service. Price: Not cheap, but great if you consider how much meat you get for how much you pay.  Verdict: Simply good and hearty Brazilian.",4.0,"Oct 7, 2022"
"This is my first time in the NYC location. I've tried the Boston one before and this one is pretty much the same. They come around very frequently with all different sorts of meat cuts and you can get as much as your heart desires. I think there's definitely a strategy involved here where you want to sample as much as possible but don't want to get full too early, so it's good to split some of the cuts with a friend or partner. The meat itself is not bad but some pieces can be very dry or tasteless, so YMMV. The unlimited salad bar is also pretty decent but the food quality varies. Some of the vegetables don't taste very fresh, but their watermelon is pretty good - I could feel my stomach ballooning up with all the watermelon I ate. I probably won't be coming back here until a year or 2 later because you definitely need a lengthy recovery time after having AYCE brazillian meat.",5.0,"Sep 19, 2022"
What an amazing experience. This is the first time I got to come to the NYC location. It was such a great experience. The waiters were very attentive. The customer service was A1 you can tell they are constantly watching they came over to my table to remove plates.. refill water.. get drink orders they were consistently in and out so helpful.The unlimited meat options coming to the table was great!! Some meat I liked more than others but all were good. They had happy hour drink options during dinner but my favorite drink was the pineapple one they walk around offering.The salad bar was good everything looked fresh as soon as things got low they grabbed it to replace.

"I came here this past Friday night for a wedding rehearsal dinner and had a nice first time experience at Fogo de Chao. There is a buffet for non-steak options where you can get ample of vegetables, cheese, and other delicious foods. If you're here to get your fill for steak, then don't let the buffet distract you! Otherwise, I found the mozzarella, Caesar salad, cauliflower, and sliced pineapples to be quite delicious. they also had some cured hams and pepperoni if you want something more like a charcuterie board. Fogo de Chao is crowded so the servers will come by with steaks on a stick like a large skewer. They told us we would be trying 16 types of meats but it's honestly pretty hard to hear what you're trying since they're pretty busy trying to get to other tables as well. I'm not even sure if I tried all 16 types but my rule of thumb is if it looks fresh out of the oven and tasty, then ask for a slice or two. I personally found some cuts to be pretty dry and/or lacked seasoning. However, there were a few steaks I tried that were absolutely delicious and salted very well, and so tender! It is definitely very heavy, though. Fogo de Chao is probably not somewhere I'd go to very often because of that. The desserts were pretty sweet and heavy as well. I could only stomach a few bites of each one. Overall, good first time experience. It is quite crowded and the servers have a lot to do so you might not get all the cuts you'd want to try.",2.0,"Dec 26, 2023"
Came here for Christmas. We had a reservation at 8pm and were seated shortly after. We enjoyed drinks at the bar while we were waiting. Once seated we ordered two more drinks and did the full experience. We have been to several Fogo De Chaos all over so this is not new to us.The waiter told us to go enjoy the salad bar so we did. We noticed there was no place cards on the table we figured since it was busy maybe that's why he told us to go to the salad bar. We waited another 10-15 mins and we were just sitting there wondering where the cards for. He said he forgot and put them down. After that we immediately started getting different types of meats. That service was fast and they were attentive. We didn't see the waiter again we had to stop someone else who looked like a manger to ask for a dessert menu. Then finally we got the waiters attention to order the dessert. We could not get his attention for the check we spend more time waiting from wanting to order dessert to trying to pay the bill than we did eating. The waiter is what ruined our experience. The overall quality of the meat is the same that we have experienced at all the fogo de chaos so that came out expected it was the service which made the experience lack. We would not come back to this location for that reason.,5.0,"Feb 16, 2024"

"When a friend from out of town wanted to have lunch here I was baffled - it's a chain, and why wouldn't you want to go somewhere local in nyc?  But after a visit I was sold.  For $20 you get unlimited salad bar and for $10 more you can get prime beef.   For nyc - it's fairly good price and good quality.  The salad bar has salad, cheeses, cold cuts, fresh papaya, fresh pineapple, pastas, marinated mushrooms and more.  I never get to try everything. There's so much food I can't write it all, but it's like being on a cruise.  If you get a meat you get mashed potatoes, Maduros, and fried yucca.  One of the best things is the starter croissant round w melted cheese inside.  Come hungry.",4.0,"Aug 7, 2023"

"Everything was flavorful and hot off the grill stick so to speak. As advised, I would only have 2 pieces of the original fat capped picanha steak. Top and bottom sirloin, filet and garlic steak kebab. I get it. Service and ambiance were also plentiful and courteous, but for the wait on rib eye (we'd never get) and garlic steak.

"Service was ALL OVER THE PLACE, taking many minutes to seat us, bring us water, and our drinks when we were very quick and concise with ordering. Steaks were cut nice but seasoning and cooking temp ""medium, rare, etc"" were very off.

"It's very crowded and noisy but worth it for the food in my opinion. Young children are noisy in general so if you have kids I actually think this is a good environment to eat with them. If they are below a certain age (forgot which exactly but went with a 5 year old and that was definitely young enough) they can eat the buffet and endless meat for free.The buffet and endless meat is great - especially worth it for anyone with a big appetite.

"Whatever you do, do not let them persuade you to sit upstairs.My third time here, but my first time being seated upstairs, was quite a disappointment.  You come to Fogo de Chao for the meats and efficiency. The staff are always friendly enough, but the desire to simply sale, is ever-present.  You overlook the lack of any genuine spirit, cuz they always deliver where it counts - THE MEATS! That is until you sit upstairs where it was very difficult to have the full experience of the restaurants. We kept being served a rotation of the same three of four meats, and when we requested other selections, it took quite a while to make its way upstairs.  Anyhoo, I highly recommend this place, but, again, DO NOT SIT UPSTAIRS.",4.0,"Sep 6, 2023"
"Great time with friends! Great for groups and very crowded in the evenings. Very loud. Food was very good and came nonstop but some cuts could have used more flavor. The servers did a great job making sure each person got the cuts of new trhey wanted (medium rare vs medium well). Perhaps we were coming too late (small group seated around 9pm) but there weren't as many cuts as we were expecting. The salad bar and carbs were extremely well seasoned and tasty (yuca fries, cheese bread, mashed potatoes). Too full for dessert but maybe next time!",4.0,"Jan 31, 2023"
"I had been to Fogo de Chao in another state. Since it was my mom's birthday, I wanted to treat her to a place she loved since she visited me in another state. I made a reservation in advance to ensure we got in even though it was a weekday since it could be popular. This fogo is multilevel and we ate at the bottom floor where the salad bar was.Overall, our waiter was the sweetest and made sure we had everything we needed. We shifted tables because our original spot was not well lit and my mother was antes it to see the menu.The menu was standard to what I have seen at other Fogo. However, the vibes are different. On the upper floors, there are bars and tv screens for sports near a bar. This was available in other locations but I had not seen it as popular as it was here. There is the all day happy hour so that could of be a reason. But since it is in midtown near popular sites and across the street from the moma. I can see why more people would come here to chill and not just because of the people carrying meat skewers. The meat is as great as usual and everyone was kind. I most likely coming back at the very least for her next birthday. Plus they do takeout so if I really need picanha, I know where to go",5.0,"Dec 11, 2022"
"I went to Fogo de Chão for a bday dinner and I am happy to announce that my life is forever changed and I will never be the same. Everything was so GOOD. I swear I dreamt of meat for at least 4 days following the dinner. The highlights were the parmesan pork chops, lamb, ribs and of course the pão de queijo. I think I ate a thousand pieces of it by the end of the night. If you have room for dessert, I highly recommend. We got the sampler but and they were all out of this world. Also there's an all day happy hour drink menu which was great. Our waiter and host was so attentive and the service was great, but that might be because we were in a private room.

My favorite Brazilian steakhouse! I've been coming here for years with a bunch of friends to celebrate various birthdays and gatherings. With a bev the total comes out to about a hunnit a head so it's not cheap you kinda gotta have to have a appetite. The cold bar is probably one of the most impressive in New York with so many different side dishes to choose from. The servers are quick and readily available and you can request certain cuts and they will bring it to you. The ambiance leans more towards the high end so business casual is preferred for this restaurant.,1.0,"Oct 14, 2023"

"I usually have a great experience here, but this last time I visited assured I won't be back. The white male waiter that worked on 4/23 was so rude to my friend and I. He literally rolled his eyes when we said we didn't want to drink (at 2:00pm on a Sunday) and instead of bringing us tap water brought us a $17 bottle of mineral water we didn't ask for. We never saw him again and thankfully our second waiter was a Black woman who was nicer, but the first one put such a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't enjoy my meal, in part also because we ran out of fried bananas and nobody asked us if we wanted more. Please do a hospitality training for your white servers who clearly feel like they're too good to serve Black people who are coming to have a good time. We were celebrating my friends birthday, which I said in my reservation and got no acknowledgment about that. Very disappointed to say the least.",5.0,"Nov 8, 2023"

"ZERO STARS!!!!!Worst dining experience of my life . I can't even think where to begin , because I can't even tell which part was the worst of it, and it's hard to wrap my head around how ridiculously awful this experience was. DO NOT come here for a group larger than 3!!! They cannot handle it !!! They are incompetent , disorganized, and untrained and simply do not care about your event.!! Let me see.. how can I start to break this down.I made a reservation for 12 people, one full month in advance. I confirmed my reservation via email and text the day before. Then I called the same day of event and confirmed if it was OK that I was bringing birthday balloons and wanted to place them on the table. They said ""OK NO PROBLEM SEE YOU LATER."" On the phone. My group of 10 arrive at 7:50, 10 minutes before our reservation. They refuse to sit us and tell us all 12 need to be there. We told them 2 couldn't make it. Suddenly ? they don't have a table at all for us and we are waiting 40 minutes at the door before they can seat us. What happened to our table for 12? Clearly - they never had a table. So we're standing there with our balloons while at least 50 people are going in and out of the restaurant ahead of us. The restaurant is so extremely packed you can't even walk by, you have to wait for others to walk before you can walk. Tables on top of tables and no spacing. We get to the table , and it's missing 2 chairs. So they didn't even have a table for 10 ready, nonetheless lied to us earlier about having 12. and to top it off, we're seated all the way in the back of the restaurant; Therefore the people coming around with the meat are coming to us last , if not at all? I've been to beautiful Fogo de Chao locations around the country, and the meat is supposed to feel like it's rotating nonstop. I'm leaving this location hungry, can you imagine? The waiters had no idea how the menu worked. Some of us were vegetarian and only wanted the cold food bar and some of us wanted the meat experience. It took 3 different waiters to explain that the bar menu was one price and the meat buffet was another price because the 3 waiters all said completely different things. ( I personally knew how it worked because I've been to Fogo before but the other people at the table were extremely confused by what they were being told) To top it all off they put our 1,000$ bill on one check. As if the 10 of us are supposed to be paying with one check?? They didn't even ask. And so when we asked them to split it, they told us they would not do that. So for 40 minutes, our table had to hash out who got what. Horrible horrible horrrible birthday experience. Ruined the night for everyone. Everyone was stale quiet and sadly eating their food when we're supposed to be celebrating. Had to add to the car meters and change our after party plans because we were there for an additional hour for our table and then an additional hour to pay the check. Ambience was ugly. I bought a nice professional camera to take pictures and there wasn't even a nice area to take them in being that the restaurant was so packed and lacked any kind of decor .",2.0,"Jan 27, 2024"
"Fogo de Chao offers a very open and tastefully modern ambiance, one of the best one can find in NYC. The service is great as one would expect in the Brazilian steakhouse style, given that green light means they will keep coming. The salad bar is fresh and plentiful, offering the things that are fresh and acidic to counter all the protein soon to be consumed. However, I was a bit underwhelmed by the flavor of the meat and that was surprising. The chicken came first and it fell flat. My long time friend from college, a great cook in her own right and a certified foodie, felt the same. One does not come to a steakhouse and are less than impressed and, if it happens and you have a reliable friend with you, you'll ask if they feel the same for confirmation. The bacon wrapped chicken and steak could not be helped with the assist. The garlic steak moved the flavor needle, but it should with the somewhat heavy hand of garlic used. This is an indication the quality of the meats is in doubt. Any steakhouse should offer a level of quality that stands on its own, without the need for bacon wrapping or fairly heavy handed garlic for the assist. If I can recall only the lamb, top sirloin and pork belly as flavorful at this location of Fogo de Chao, then there are too many other misses with the other offerings and the quality becomes a prime suspect for the lack of flavor.At $75 for the full Monty, it may come down to what can reasonably be expected for the variety and quantity offered. There is no way to leave hungry and everyone will be entertained by the frequent and friendly visits of the wait staff. This would be a great place to visit with a group of friends or colleagues, when the attention to the quality and flavor is not as focused when alone or with another person. Service and ambience are very good, but there should not have been any waste on my plate at a steakhouse, but there was and I noticed I was not alone when others finished eating. It gets three stars and the third is added owing to the service and ambience, which were very good.",3.0,"May 8, 2023"

"Hello,Wanted to say that the food we received was great and all but it was slow. We came around 12:00 pm on a Saturday (Brunch). We were seated quickly since we had a reservation. We were seated in a corner even though there was a lot of open space in the middle or on the side. That was a problem since no one would notice us if we turned the card to request more meat. The servers were barely approaching us. I don't know if this is a strategy for us to get full with the sides or what but it took away the experience of what we were expecting. Another thing, my wife and I went to get some additional sides then came back with a waitress already collecting our plates and utensils. That person didn't even ask us if we were done eating. I understand about the plates, but for her to take the utensils away as well was rude. This was around 1:25 pm. I know we were taking our time, this is because we were waiting for the cuts of meat to be offered to us, even asking the other servers for specific cuts so that we could get out in a timely manner as well.I hope Fogo De Chao management will fix this.",5.0,"Oct 27, 2023"

"I used to think Fogo was excellent, but the service I had today left me with a bad feeling. As they sat me I felt like I was being up-sold on their many extra options as well as pressured to buy a drink. I turned down all the extras because the Full Churrasco Experience is plenty of food and variety and actually a good deal for the lunch price. The server asked if I'd like sparkling or still water and I said still. I went to the salad bar and came back to find a tall bottle of specialty mineral water on my table. I apologized to the server and told him I just wanted tap which wasn't an option he mentioned in his initial pitch. He took the bottle away slightly annoyed. I've learned now to always ask for a cut that's very rare because more and more often, the meat is coming out over cooked and dry.When it came time for the check he told me to wait a moment because he had another table to see to. No problem. But he never came back. I had to flag down another waiter to get my check which he did happily. Then my original server came back and said oops I forgot your check to which I told him someone else is getting it. The check came and because I was in a little bit of a hurry, I just put my card in the folder and they ran it. I signed, tipped 20%, and I left. It wasn't until I was walking away did I realize that lunch wasn't usually that expensive and it dawned on me, he didn't take off the fancy water that I asked him to take away. Anyway, lessons learned -- always look at the final bill and don't be so trusting. Also, if they're trying to up-sell, just slow down the tempo of the sales pitch, smile, and say no thank you with confidence.",1.0,"Jan 9, 2024"

"I made a reservation for lunch Saturday Dec 30th  in New York, R 999895926I was celebrating my wife birthday, Evening went well until the server brought the check, I wanted to apply the $15 off that I got in the mail, But the interaction went wrong from that point forward;The server didn't know how to apply the code to my check, when I asked she said ""I don't know, it doesn't work""  I showed her my phone with the email with the code, she continued to say ""I don't know"" ""I don't know"" I offer her to take my phone so she can apply the code or find a manager to help her, but she start asking for my credit card to run the payment,  I didn't accept that so I ask her to find a manager to help her. Surely after Carlos came with the check, the $15 off was applied to my check, I gave him my card for the remaining balance, and I mentioned to him ""I feel that the server was rude and not helpful, that he should address that behavior with her""He apologized, he was super nice an understanding, he even brought a desert to us.  I Feel he understood, I was very satisfied. But then the server came back to my table to recriminate why we had complained, she even told us that we were the rude people because I showed her my phone with the code.

"I came with a friend for brunch and had, hands down, one of the best experiences ever at Fogo. The staff was amazing. Ana took the best care of us checking in and telling us about off menu items.

"I made reservations here for my birthday Feb 25th and was originally going to have 12 people. I was contacted by their event coordinator and offered the Amethyst package. I was really pleased with the process of making my reservation. I did note however that I requested half booth of possible, due to traffic I arrived 20 minutes late with my party so one wasn't available. I cannot blame them if that's the case.The food was incredible and awesome. Everything was delicious. The waiters was very attentive with our drinks and requests. When it comes to the food we were very satisfied.4 of my original party didn't make it and I was left with only 8 guests but they still honored the group rate they gave me when I made my reservation. This was greatly appreciated. They also took the time to split the check so we could pay as smaller groups since some of us were couples, some were single, and some wanted extras, others did not. They were very accommodating and this was very appreciated.My one complaint was the temperature in the restaurant. It was freezing. I couldn't remove my sweater because I routinely needed to hide my arms inside it. We were sitting in the back by one of the exits leading to the parking lot and every time someone left it got colder. I requested they turn up the heat the waiter was very apologetic that there was not much he could do. Apparently the power outlets near where we were seated were not working so they could not place a space heater at our table. Eventually they did attempt to use a space heater by running an extension cord but sadly it did not help. The bathroom was also Ice Cold and had no hot water. On my walk to the bathroom I did notice the center of the restaurant by the half booth WAS much warmer but at this point it was too late for me to ask for them to move as dinner was winding down and they had stopped serving meat. We were so cold we elected to take our dessert home. Oh, they also apparently had limited dessert options. We were told the Cheese cake was frozen and only had Key Lime Pie and Chocolate Moose as options. Both were DELICIOUS, but I was hoping for the Cheesecake!After all is said and done despite the freezing cold I really enjoyed the meal and I'd 100% come back again; however this time if it was this cold I'd likely get up and leave. I want to come back to the food again. The meat was delightful and delicious. I got the Wagyu Ribeye and my friend got the Wagyu NY Strip and my other friend got the Lobster add on. We were very satisfied with every single bite!I hope to come again one day but PLEASE FIX THE HEAT! I ended up with a respiratory infection I'm still recovering from!",4.0,"Jun 13, 2022"
"Let me start by saying service was impeccable and may be the best I have seen in the city.  Staff were informed, attentive, had initiative to offer other appetizers and sides, but provided space when needed. There was a good selection of meats, but it seems Churrascaria may have more choices. The lamb sirloin was perfect, and the other cuts were really good. I hesitated on the chicken leg but even that was roasted well and was juicy.The Papaya Cream was delicious and the crème de cassis made it all the better.",4.0,"Feb 15, 2018"

"My family and friends celebrated a birthday dinner on February 3, 2024 with a reservation at 10PM. Was seated quickly and that seemed to be the only positive part of our experience. Once seated we were not greeted by any server, after staring down multiple servers and managers a manager came to greet us and get our drinks. We let her know that we're celebrating a birthday and would like a dessert to come when we're finished. Food was good per usual and got the regular sides except missing the cheese bread. I had to ask 3 people with one being a manager to bring bread to the table and finally got it after 15 minutes. We continue our meal and as we're finishing our meal I try to find the manager I spoke to in the beginning for the cake. She was nowhere to be found. We finished our meal and went ahead to ask a different manager for the birthday dessert to be brought to our table and he said ""Yes, of course. I'll bring it to your table."" After 20 minutes the cake had not arrived to the table. We then had to ask 3 more people for the cake, which was brought out after 15 minutes of asking the 3rd server. We waited from 10:45-11:30 for our birthday dessert. While waiting for the dessert we had asked for our bill and seperate checks. After about 45 minutes of waiting for the bill the bill then arrived with everything on 1 check. we felt we did not receive quality service so we left a 5% tip. A server by the name of Reginaldo then opened the check while it is still on the table, picks it up and turns around. Turns back around to us and says ""18% is the minimum required service charge, you need to put atleast this amount, do that for us please"" and handed us the pen and checkbook back. As everyone is aware tip is based on service which we did not receive, then to say 18% is required is absolutely ridiculous. After hearing that from Reginaldo, we grabbed a manager who said ""It's okay, you don't need to do that"" but he was very quick with his response and seemed to not even care. Reginaldo who never came to our table before dropping the check was trying to scam us by saying it is required. I've dined at multiple Fogo De Chaos in multiple states and have NEVER had such a HORRIBLE experience.",1.0,"Feb 6, 2024"
"Kara, we are sincerely apologetic for any frustration or disappointment caused during what should have been a celebratory dinner at our New York location.

"TOO SALTY! My wife and I went to Fogo de Chao in Manhattan in December 2022. The place was packed (tables are packed close together) and lively. The servers were very nice, although it seemed to take forever to get a glass of wine or a glass of water. My reviews:MEAT: Salty, salty, salty. I love properly seasoned beef, but the salt on the beef was overbearing. As for taste, each type of beef was gamey. Strange but true. The lamb they brought was even gamier. I love lamb, and I don't mind when lamb is a bit gamey, but the lamb they served me was so strong that I couldn't eat it. And, again, the beef was gamey too. Tough, too, except for the beef ribs which were fatty and tender. But did I mention the salt? By the end of the meal, I didn't want to eat more meat because I couldn't stand the thought of more salt. Is this intentional (so people don't eat too much meat)? I think so.In addition, I found each cut of beef to be tough (except for the ribs). Even the filet mignon. Lamb was tough, too.  DRINKS: I ordered three glasses of wine, and they very very small pours. Disappointing.SIDES: They brought some sides to the table which we delicious, but the potatos were tooooo rich and creamy. I did ask for some french fries, which they brought me for free. That was nice.SALAD BAR: Fine.I will never go back to Fogo de Chao. I would rather spend my money getting a perfectly seasoned, cooked steak at an upscale steak place.",5.0,"Feb 17, 2023"

"I've been to Fogo in other cities before but never tried just the Market Table for weekday lunches. Currently priced around $19, the Market Table has a great selection of fresh veggies, fruit, meat, cheese, and dips. Some highlights for me were the elote, cauliflower, pineapple, and seasonal hummus.  I'm also glad we got to enjoy my fave pao de queijo (cheese balls), plaintains, garlic mashed, and polenta fries. Everything tasted pretty good, but you definitely get full really fast because most of the foods are on the heavier side. But for $19, you really can't beat the price. You can also add on meat for around $8-10 which would still be a solid deal.",5.0,"Sep 19, 2023"
"Large spacious area, with great servers and great overall atmosphere. Beautifully decorated interior, great location. Amazing first time experience of churrasco. You receive a card, one side green indicating to bring out more meat, and the red side indicating to stop. We started with the salad bar, which was fresh and delicious. Had a variety of different greens, meats, and salads. Various meats were served, our favorite was the lamb and beef dishes. Great side dishes.",5.0,"Sep 2, 2023"
"Had a terrible experience celebrating my birthday at this establishment.1. The hosts sounded like they did not want to be there. We had reservations at 2:30pm, I took them 40 minutes to seat us down. I was wondering why bother having a reservation system if you are going to make your guests wait anyway.2. The all you can eat experience was mediocre. The waiters kept skipping our table. we were always missing the complimentary bread, had to beg for water refill.3. Because they sat us down late, they charged us dinner price instead of lunch. Our reservation was at 2:30pm. We arrived at 2:20pm. They only sat us down at 3:10pm. Overall, please if you want a truly Brazilian steakhouse experience, go to Churrascaria Plataforma. They have much better customer experience, better servers, and meat quality.

"Took my mom here for Mother's Day because for some reason Fogo de Chão ends up being one of her favorite restaurants Even with a reservation, you'll find yourself waiting so you might want to book a table for 15+ minutes earlier than when you'd actually want to be seated. The drinks are good so can't complain much about that. The drink menu isn't that big but they'll allow you to order drinks that aren't on the menu so be prepared that they won't get it right if it's not one of their regular drinks. I ordered a champagne martini and it was alright, I'd say 6/10The salad bar is ok and nothing spectacular. Other patrons are gross so you may want to skip itThe food itself is mostly good but some meats were over cooked or were not seasoned well so tasted bland. The variety was good. The staff was all over the place:- hostess was probably the worst part of the whole thing. They were friendly but not very bright and extremely slow to seat us- the servers were actually very good.  They were quick, got everything right the first time, and checked in from time to time- the staff bringing out the meats would skip tables or not pay attention to whether the table had red or green. They should incorporate some sort of light system or just go to every table. There were a lot of times where we wanted to see what was coming out but they would never look or stop by - the bartender was ok and tried his best when it came to custom drinks but even some drinks on the menu were not good. At one point the server said she would take back 2 bad drinks but the bartender wasn't around for a while to make new drinks One thing I didn't like was that we were seated on the top floor which was great for private convo. The bartender is located there but like I mentioned, he wasn't always around so getting drinks was delayed, also you had to take a janky service elevator to get down to the salad bar if you wanted something from thereoverall it was alright but there are better alternatives",4.0,"Jun 30, 2021"

"I was hoping for this to be our annual Thanksgiving restaurant, but the performance was less than acceptable. Ther server who was pushing bottles of wine. We declined a bottle of wine. He pushed a new bottle. We said no again. He wouldn't take no for an answer and was incredibly rude. Our friends have stopped drinking this year-- so having a bottle of wine on the table is out of the question. The waiter stopped visiting our table for 45 minutes--despite us asking for checks. We were in a back room with horrible temperature control that was extremely hot. We asked for potatoes with no chives and they took 30 minutes to come out.The turkey was served coldWe asked for more filet and they never came out.We asked for more chicken legs and they never came out.We asked for refills on black beans--they never came out.Stuffing was cold. A check was brought to our table but was not from our actual table. Why were you trying to pass off someone else's bill on us? What really grinded our gears was being told we were unable to split checks because they were 'too busy'. In 2021-- they gave us a palm pilot and we could split our checks and it was super easy. The manager was rude, and just said-- told me what to charge and refused to split checks based on what we ordered. Leadership has not provided answers to:--Our reservation was at 6pm, and we were not sat until 6:30. The front desk told me you overbooked by 20%. Why did you overbook? --Our server was relentless on upselling us bottles of wine--Our table was not visited by a server for almost 45 minutes. --Our friend was still eating, but no more meat was coming out. --Why were we unable to split checks? Is this your new policy? Why were we not notified?",5.0,"Feb 19, 2023"

"Decided to make dinner reservations to celebrate my college graduation and so happy I did.I had the churrasco experience which included the market table and salad bar. I only had 1 trip to the salad bar as after a few bites I was stuffed. It was so much food. The market table items are sweet plantains, garlic mashed potatoes, polenta fries, and cheesy bread. All of the delicious cuts of meat and the items from the salad bar... Whew! I was stuffed...I ate a piece of garlic steak that spoke to my soul. Omg it was so good. Literally the best thing I've tasted out of the entire meal.The staff, the ambiance, and the food was excellent!They have both indoor and outdoor dining.

All the meats were unflavored and they waited so long to bring the meats.They basically brought raw even though I ask for well done.The can feijoada that I get from the supermarket was better than theirs.The pão de queijo (Cheese bread) had more oil than cheese. Obs: I wasted most of the food. I was chocked with the price that I had to pay for the food with this experience. However, definitely not recommended, the only good thing was the location besides that the rest wasn't worth.Custumer service was ""ok"" and they didn't care about my meet preferences or how I liked to be cooked. And I ask for more kind of meats but they just brought chicken legs and picanha. Which they offered multiple times even tho I rejected multiple time as well.Plus: They were giving some kind of meats that wasn't event the real meat that they mention.

I've been to a few locations and generally like Fogo chain. It was however an extremely disappointing experience at this midtown location last night.  It's at lower level and comparably smaller ---- not big deal. The dinning room was freezing! How cold was it? Almost all customers were wearing their winter jackets! And then fire alarm went up with the loud noise so for a decent 10 minutes we couldn't hear each other. Waiters had no sympathy. The host/manager never showed up to apologize.

"The food and our waitress were AMAZING. However the hostess and the woman calling your name need to be removed from their jobs or need further training. I was there on Nov 11 for a birthday dinner that I booked in advance. We got there about 25-30 min early. I approached the hostess and told her I would be adding an extra person to my already 13 person dinner. She didn't even bother to read the instructions of wishing my uncle a happy birthday she just asked if we were all there and since we were early we were not so she told us to approach her again when everyone was there. Then at 5:48 ish the person sitting us approached us and asked again how many ppl were at the restaurant and at that moment we were 12 expecting 2 more who were on the way. She then proceeded to give us a nasty attitude and tell us ""if they are not here in the next 30 min you're loosing your reservation"" 1. How is it that you're threaten us with canceling our reservation when our reservation wasn't until 6 it was 5:48 pm... like who are you timing us when our time haven't even started?? 2nd how dare you speak to guests like that specially when my uncle chose that location to celebrate such  a special day like his birthday? Honestly it wouldn't had matter if it was his birthday no one deserves to be spoken like that. You are acting like you are giving me free food! On top of that once the two people we were waiting on arrive they told them there was no reservation under the name they had provided... like what?!!!

"Wonderful experience and wonderful service!!!!We went here to celebrate a grandparent's 80th birthday :)The food was amazing and the ambience excellent. Upscale spacious restaurant - design rarely found in many places in the city.  Great for large groups!The meat options were incredible and very well executed and delivered.We did the all you can eat option in two forms:1) most of us did the one including all the tender meats (chicken, lamb, pork, steak)2) a few of us did the option that was the marketplace salad bar option only (which also had some chicken salad, lox, and cured meats)Both options were fantastic and all of us were stuffed with whichever choice. The only downside was that the menu at the table was very confusing and that the dining options were not clearly presented.  Appetizers and beverages seemed to just be immediately offered in a way that felt like they were upcharging without explaining how the dining options worked.  This made for a very uncomfortable and awkward start.   Would suggest that the restaurant make the menu more transparent and clear with regards to the options. Overall, had a nice celebratory experience and they graciously created a dessert for the birthday grandparent. Would definitely recommend and come back.",5.0,"Jul 1, 2023"

"I only paid 44$ for the cuts of Brazil special, and I am so happy I didn't end up paying for the full dinner service. Nearly all of the meat is underseasoned and improperly rested - resulting in tough and chewy meat with little flavor. Beyond this almost all of the meat is medium well - well done, if not it's like super rare. I left with a stomach ache feeling unsatisfied. Their drinks were also notably bad - with the Jorge's sour tasting as if it were straight out of a dive bar. Do not think I'll ever find myself in a Fogo de Chão again.",3.0,"Mar 7, 2022"
"Nov 2021- the food is absolutely delicious. Definitely opt for the buffet. Their salad bar had such a variety of quality things to choose from besides your typical tossed greens. They had hummus, prosciutto, various cheeses, so many types of salads and chilled seafood items.The highlight of this restaurant is their carved meats. On your table you're given a round coaster type thing. One side is green and the other is red. You flip it over to green when you'd like the meat servers to stop at your table. The meats were so juicy!! My only complaint is that we had to wave down the server for the homemade sausages since he overlooked our table a few times. The customer service is great. The hostess was friendly, the servers were quick and attentive. The workers stationed at the salad bar were also on top of it refilling the items and keeping things neat.The restaurant itself is a beautiful space. The restrooms were clean.You can make reservations easily on Open Table.You'll definitely have a nice looking bill at the end. Our bill came out to +$350 for 3 buffet options and a few drinks. But you'll definitely taste the quality and care put into the foods and be satisfied afterwards.I'm so glad we went to this restaurant and am looking forward to going again next time I'm in NYC.",5.0,"Mar 7, 2022"

"at this price point, fogo de chao seemed like a place to celebrate a special occasion or entertain guests.  but the execution was just off during their weekend brunch/dinner service.  - the menu we received was a shortened version so unless you looked on the website, you wouldn't know that there are fish and vegetarian options- the brunch salad bar had bacon, but none of the other brunch options- an omelet station was set up, but it was not staffed- no one acknowledged that we were celebrating a special occasion- the first sign of this odd experience is that no one called to confirm/remind us of our reservationour servers, however, were cheerful and helpful when we asked for anything.   our table really enjoyed the fried cheese with honey that has to be requested from the kitchen.  so, i would come back for a casual buffet experience, but not as a place to impress.",3.0,"Mar 15, 2023"
"My girlfriend and I dined at the 53rd Street location on 10/21/23. We were seated on the top floor table 300/1 near the bar. We got to the top floor and was greeted by a female with great posture and smile. We later found out she was the Manager. Absolutely no regrets! Our Server, Julia and the Manager, Anna were nothing short of amazing. There was another server by the name of Chinzilla who was also very nice an attentive. Julia is the type of server who managers/owners should strive to hire. She was very attentive, professional yet friendly, consistent with all her tables and knew about the menu. The food, drinks and desserts were fantastic. We got the bill and I asked to speak with the manger because I needed express our satisfaction with the service she provided. I didn't realize my tone made Julia feel as thought something was wrong or we not satisfied (which was NOT the case). It was very busy but Anna arrived in a timely manner ready to fix what she assumed was wrong. We complemented Julia on her service and I apologized profusely to Julia and Anna. I would definitely return in hopes of being served by them. We left feeling full, satisfied and happy! We will definitely return.",5.0,"Oct 29, 2023"

I believe the restaurant takes up there stories and there are some cool views of the restaurant from the upstairs bars. It's a cool place to hang out.We were there for a cocktail event so we did t experience the typical Rodizio but we did have some great food. My favorite item was their grilled cheese with honey while my wife enjoyed the lamb chops. I enjoyed some wine throughout the evening too. Before we left, I had a glass of scotch. They had a fair variety of whiskey. Not a huge selection but definitely a nice array with options a all different price points.",4.0,"Mar 31, 2022"

"Big fan of Brazilian steakhouses so was excited when we managed to get a reservation at Fogo de Chao during Restaurant Week. It ended up okay.....  The service was good and there was plenty of meat but perhaps except for the picanha, the selections for one reason or another were not very impressive. Some like the pork and chicken were a little dry while others did not seem to be properly seasoned.That being said, the Restaurant Week menu is a great deal and do not regret going. However, all else being equal I would probably choose Texas de Brazil (better tasting meats and better salad bar) over Fogo",4.0,"Jan 2, 2023"

"I always look forward to trying the different types of meats/poultry served on skewers. There didn't seem to have much variety for this type of restaurant on the day of our visit. I had high hopes to try a wide variety of offerings. Instead we got what seemed to be three different steaks, bacon wrapped chicken, chicken drumsticks, and that's it. The salad bar was subpar. There again were not impressive choices. There were veggie choices. The soup was good - butternut squash. I didn't leave feeling stuffed which is how I normally feel after one of these all you can eat meals. However I did like the special cocktails and desserts though!",3.0,"Mar 11, 2022"

"I love brazilian churasscaria & have been to this location before. We went last night & it was just like going in to buy a used car. As we sat down we literally were rushed with up selling on our meal. The waiter asked if we wanted bottle water...we got sparkling which is the norm for me...we also ordered alcoholic drinks which is norm as well for us, and we would've stayed longer to drink if they just RELAXED!  but he kept shoving the wine bottles down our throats  & we dont drink wine. Then he kept trying to upsell us on the upgraded meat/steak selection...like we hadn't even sat down for 2 minutes to even see what we were feeling like.... Or what there was on the regular pre fixe....making us feel awkward & pressured with the bum rush on over selling us...he asks if we want any other drinks on top of the sparkling water & alcohol..we said I think thats good to start with. Then he starts with the upsell on appetizers ...we hadnt even seem what the salad bar had yet. As he walks away another server comes over to sell us a card to help hungry children in need...we literally hadn't even gotten water yet. LIKE WTF. When are u approached about donation & charity at a restaurant even before you have eaten!!! Or ever!!!!!! Did we come to eat a restaurant or to buy a car???? There were over 50 servers all around us ready to sell us more things...they offered additional appetizers to buy again ....when there is so much food that you get anyway cause its all you can eat. Like relax...let us get started & slowly work ur sales into it! As a professional sales person...i hated every minute of this & didn't even get to enjoy a relaxing meal with a friend in town....we felt bum rushed & THE UP SELLING just ruined the experience. Not to mention the drinks he was so eager to sell us didn't even come out for 20 mins cause they forgot the order. AND IN ADDITION I had made reservation on the site & it was $44 special per person mentioned on the site at time of making reservation but the bill came & they charged us $75 regular price & i had to have them adjust it. I've always liked how nice of a location it is but the dining experience was mehhhh & not enjoyable. Maybe spending more time cleaning & re filling the salad bar is more important for your workers to focus on than selling us cards to donate to starving children before we even started eating! HOW TACKY!!!  And to teach your servers & more seamless way to upsell than the harsh pressure sell! Made me lose my taste for that restaurant completely!",1.0,"Oct 8, 2023"

"I'm honestly very surprised to see recent reviews stating bad service and bland meats at Fogo. I've come here before in 2019 for a belated birthday dinner celebration and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing service and good flavorful meats. So, I decided to come back again for another birthday celebration, this time for my mom and with a smaller group. I made a reservation for brunch this past weekend. When my party and I arrived, we were promptly seated and had all our questions answered by our waiter. We, of course, did the churrasco experience and had the salad bar and brunch features included since it was the weekend (it is automatically brunch from 11:30-2pm.  At first, it did seem like no one was coming to our table with meat, but after 15-20 minutes, people started coming around. They actually made sure to come to us as long as we made eye contact and had our cards flipped over on the green side. And honestly, the cuts were super fresh and flavorful! Of course, there were some cuts I liked more than others like the filet mignon, but that's all persona preference. The salad bar was also super great and a nice way to refresh the palette in between the different meats. I also tried the made to order omelette, which was super good. We also got the complimentary sides such as mashed potato, fried plantains, and the fried yuka chips. All of the sides complimented the meats. Also, FYI, they have happy hour all day now. So, we were able to get a bottle of red wine for the table for $28! Definitely ask your waiter what they recommend and what the happy hour bottles are! The biggest surprise, however, was when a piece of cheesecake was brought to the table at the end. When you make a reservation now, you're prompted to specify what the occasion is. It was super nice to get a birthday slice for my mom with a candle and all! Overall, Fogo is definitely a nice experience to have for a special occasion. I would also note that I definitely enjoyed both the brunch and dinner, but feel that it is better to go during brunch since the salad bar is included!",4.0,"Dec 7, 2021"

"Excellent service! It is fancy dining so I recommend that you dress up a bit. My colleague made a reservation here for lunch at 12pm on a Saturday. For all you can eat buffet here it's $60, not including tip and tax. We dined inside. They have a nice selection of salads, fruits, and appetizers at a salad/fruit bar where a waiter guides you and transfers the food items you pick to your plate. My colleague and I ordered a bottle of a malbec wine for $50. My colleague is a VIP here and they surprised us with 3 free desserts: a key lime pie, a chocolate cake, and a cheesecake. The waiters also gathered and sang happy birthday. I love how you can easily split the payment on their high tech calculator that is embedded with a credit card/cash payment tool. I would definitely come back here for a special occasion.  I highly recommend it.",5.0,"Oct 14, 2023"

"I've always liked Fogo de Chao, but that liking turned into ""I LOVE Fogo de Chao"" during this pandemic for sure.Their packages for delivery are really reasonably priced for how much food you get (especially if you purchase the pounds of bbq meat and sides separately, you end up with quite a few delicious meals and it's a great deal!). The meal packages are good as well - it gives you more variety, but if you know what you like, and plan to make a few additional veggie sides yourself, definitely go for order the items individually. My favorite of course is the picanha. No flavor loss from delivery and it came hot, fresh, and tasty. The bottom sirloin was pretty good as well, and the prime lamb steak was definitely another favorite. The side asparagus and pao bread is amazing as usual - even better when you can order more and eat them for breakfast the next day!Highly recommend getting delivery here - I have to admit I might like Fogo delivery even more than I'm person dining! #thankyouthuraday",3.0,"Dec 27, 2023"
"I made a 5:30 pm reservation, arrived at 5:20 but we were not seated until 6 pm. This was rather annoying because I had a baby with me. At 5:50 I asked the host and hostess how much longer the wait time would be, the woman basically ignored me and the man was just rude. The man told the woman that I had just arrived, I responded and told him that I arrived 30 minutes ago and did not just arrive and that i was just asking how much longer the wait would be, his response was that when he told her I just arrived it was something ""internal"", it didn't make much sense to me but anyhow, we were seated 10 mins later. i personally think reservations are made for a reason, not to wait 30 minutes. When I arrived, we were not asked if we wanted to check in our coats, but others were asked. Also, once seated, we waited 15 minutes for a wine menu and we had to repeatedly ask for the meats to be brung to the section we were seated in. Our waitress was very nice, and checked on us a few times or was nearby whenever we needed something. I've been to this location many times and I feel like the service has gone downhill and the buffet section has different items that are not as tasty. i won't say that I'll never go back, but I definitely won't be returning any time soon. The upstairs host and hostess really need an attitude check though because the rudeness was completely unnecessary.",4.0,"Jun 24, 2022"

"I came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. I've actually never been to a Fogo de Chao restaurant before but it's probably because I'm not a big fan of red meat. For all you red meat lovers, this place is definitely for you. You turn your card over to green and you're ready to eat meat. The best cut of meat to me was the NY strip steak. Since it was thick cut, it was not dry and super juicy. The lamb chops were good as well. Everything else (sirloin, ribs, pork, chicken) were a bit too dry to me. You also get complimentary sides: polenta fries, mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, and pao de queijo (tapioca cheese bread). The best thing was the warm pao de queijo. The Market Table & Feijoada Bar had a good selection of cold salads, cheese, cured meats, and fruit. I especially liked the exotic fruit: starfruit, kiwi, papaya. Service was really amazing since you can request a meat and they will try to bring it out for you. It was a fun place to try out once in a while but since I'm not a fan of red meat, I probably would not come back here often.",5.0,"Oct 12, 2023"
"Food was decent. About what you would expect when a 3 star hotel puts on a buffet for Easter or Mothers Day. I was expecting better. Service was not great, my waiter made a grand total of 3 visits to my table. But the dining room is packed with folks trying to upsell you. I bought this rum drink they were wandering around with for $15. Its flavor was ok, but it was such a tiny pour that you had to squint to see it in the glass. It was meant ""for me to sip on through the meal."" If I sipped it, it would have evaporated. Four people tried to sell me dessert. Yep, four. The last guy was pushy about. ""No dessert? No coffee? Are you sure?"" Ironically, after all of this high pressure up selling, not one server noticed that my wine glass had been empty for half of the time I was there. I would have loved a second glass, but they missed it. For $115 for one person, I left disappointed. I had high hopes for this place, but sadly I cannot recommend it.",2.0,"Oct 12, 2023"

Also towards the end of our meal they offered us a ""cachaca infusion"" which was $15 dollars for a shot.

"As someone who prides themselves as a aficionado of Churrascaria,  I was excited to try Fogo de Chao, as it was the last remaining rodizio on my Brazilian bucket listAtmosphere:   Compared to most any other Rodizio I have tried, the atmosphere and vibe here is more modern and more elegant than any other Brazilian restaurant. Very deceptive when you first check in, as the entrance floor is just a small hostess stand, but then you are lead to an expansive dining room, with an elegant, minimalist design, with a soaring wine rack and large lampshade type of modern chandeliers to set a pleasant but dimly lit atmosphere,  The marble marketplace salad bar is gorgeous, and I havent even gotten around to describing the food that adorns itFood:  This was the most pleasant surprise of all. As a chain restaurant, I expected the food to be somewhat ""Americanized"" but nothing could be further from the truth. The  day that I went, they even had a regular Picanha and a special Picanha, the latter which was as flavorful as any restaurant I have been to, even those in Rio and Rio do Sul. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth good,  and the other varieties of sirloin were on point. The grilled cheese with honey was very unique and quite a treat. The star of the show may have been the marketplace salad bar. To begin, everything is so fresh, and is immediately replaced when they are getting low. I never thought to combine smoked salmon with honey bacon, that may have been the highlight of my day. The soups and salads were delicious, everything is very well labeled, its tempting to just make a meal out of thisService:  We were taken to our table by the lovely Sarah, and our server and busser were fantastic,. The gauchos could not be any more pleasant, the food was flowing endlessly and the most impressive part, was depite having a huge dining room and a wide selection of meats, when we asked the gaucho or  server to come back with a specific  type  of meat, they never forgot about us, and even remembered the temperature of the meat we had ordered from last time .  Usually, in a review, I can try and put one thing I would like to see the restaurant improve on, but I am at a loss for words.

Overall fun experience with tasty food and lively environment. The meats were cooked well and the freshness of them really stood out. Service was fast and attentive when they came although because we were seated on the side sometimes it was a little harder for them to reach us. Definitely go hungry as everything is pretty rich and filling and it is all you can eat. The salad bar was also decent and it helped balance out the meat. Would recommend to others for a fun date night or a group get together however it is a bit on the pricier side. We went to celebrate a birthday and they were very sweet!,4.0,"Aug 9, 2022"

"This restaurant is a Brazilian restaurant and it is beautiful in the inside. The staff are very attentive and courteous. They come around and offer u special alcoholic drinks. The Fogo Churrasco experience is when u get to experience different meats when they come to the table. The meat was good, but a little salty. So if you have high blood pressure this restaurant is not for you. My husband did enjoy it. I had the lobster and shrimp but sautéed because I didn't want it chilled. It was ok. There was a lot of oil and onions. It wasn't my best lobster and it was small. We had those 2 meals and 1 drink each $$$$. I had a coconut martini and my husband had Smoking honey. They were both good. For side dishes the experience comes with plantains, bread, and mash potatoes. I think the salad bar too, but we decided not to use. The staff did a good job bringing out my friend's specially made cake. Overall it is a good experience, but I probably won't go back.",5.0,"Mar 2, 2023"

The staff is not only so accommodating and attentive but you can truly feel how much they love their job and take pride in their work.

"Two words : HAPPY HOUR !!My friend from Brazil brought me here one time a few weeks ago for the happy hour , I went back yesterday with 7 more friends. Everything is amazing. The delicious drinks ($4) , the beer , the appetizers ($4-6) and the HUGE picanha burguer with the faroa fries !!! ($9!) I came to have the spades here years ago and I enjoyed it. But I'm so happy they have this kind of quality food and drink deals. ( from 5 pm- 6:30 pm)",5.0,"Feb 23, 2023"
"Honestly, for what you get, it's quite overpriced. I appreciate that it's an all you can eat meat fest. However for the price, it's not worth it. I went on a weekday evening and since we have reservations, there was no wait and my party of three was seated promptly. That's all nice and fine. The waiter we had was trying too hard to be friendly and came across a bit aggressive. When you pay for higher priced meals, the wait staff general treat you a little better. Generally, when they seat you at your table, the waiter will help the females push in their chair. Our waiter practically shoved my female companions into their chairs. Once we were seated, he asked us about drinks. He asked us 3 times after we ordered tap water and continued to push us for more drinks. We ordered some simple stuff just to get him to calm down and go away. Another member of the wait staff pushed us on some cognac (I believe) and mentioned it was rare and limited time. But again, pushy. Long story short, the wait staff here try to be friendly, but come across as pushy and a bit aggressive by constantly trying to up-sell drinks. In terms of the meat, it was a bit on the salty side. Perhaps it's this ploy that encourages customers to order more drinks to offset the excessive salt in the food. The food here does not stand out. We have a good varieties of meats and were MAYBE impressed by one cut. After a certain point, we got tired of chewing because of the toughness of the meat. In addition, this place was packed. During COVID. Less than half the wait staff wore masks. Many waiters constantly bumped into our chairs and table. It's as if they are trying to pack everyone in to make up the lost months of revenue during the height of the first wave. When we tried to close out our bill, it took almost 10-20 minutes to get the attention of a waiter. Considering we paid almost $100 per person, I was highly disappointed and don't expect to return.",5.0,"Mar 30, 2023"

"We didn't have the experience like most people.  We were a group of five.  Came to dine with a reservation.  The restaurant was beautiful and come highly rated.  Therefore we had high expectations.  But once we got inside and sat down.  We got ignored by the staff.  Not sure why, but their meat staff will serve the table next to us over and over, but will walk right by our table.  We end up calling the manager and threatened to walk out before we were served.  For $71.00 a person and be ignored.  It's a two stars restaurant for us.  Tips, go during lunch. No reservation needed for lunch. Dinner is not worth the price, at least the service we were getting.Update:  June 29-2001I email my contact info as requested about a week ago.  Still waiting for a callback.Update July 1st:I got a VM from someone at the restaurant.  I then called them back immediately.  After waiting on hold, I was told that they were busy and they would call me back in 30 mins.  Well, that was two days ago.Update: July 8thStill no response from restaurant as promised.

"I went to Fogo de Chao on Saturday evening and had a reservation for 7 pm. They took about 15 minutes to sit us down. When we got to the table, our server told us to look up the menu with a QR code and took about 10 minutes to come back to us. My boyfriend ordered a lemonade and we decided on getting the Fogo Churrasco meal where you can get food from the salad bar and food from the people walking around with skewers. The salad bar food was delicious but has a very limited selection (there were only two types of cheese, a few deli meats, only 2-3 types of fruit, salads, and other items). Other Brazilian steakhouses have a huge selection of items.The ribeye, filet mignon, sirloin, picanha, lamb, pork ribs, and other meats did not have flavor at all. Their filet mignon taste like beef stew meat. The lamb was VERY gamey. I NEVER thought any lamb tasted gamey but now I know what the gamey taste that bothers everyone is like. It didn't seem like they put salt on the meats AT ALL. We waited more than an hour for the sausage because the person kept skipping our table... only to find out it was very over cooked and didn't have much flavor. The only meat that had flavor was the garlic steak which was delicious.Our sides came after 20 minutes which includes the mash potatoes, plantains, and their famous cheesy bread. I love their cheesy bread and mash potatoes.We had to remind our waiter for my boyfriend's lemonade 30 minutes in. He took another 15 minutes to bring the lemonade to us. The lemonade drink was pretty good. The service is not great since our waiter took forever to get our order and took forever to find out what was going on with the lemonade. Our waiter checked up on the party that sat next to us frequently because they ordered a lot of alcohol. He even told all the people with skewers to head to their table but couldn't bother checking on us. We wanted more cheesy bread but he couldn't bother looking our way until 45 minutes into the meal when he handled us the lemonade. We ended up spending two hours here because of all the waiting....Overall everything was gross except for the lemonade, garlic steak, cheesy bread, mash potatoes, and salad bar items. It's definitely not worth $70 to only eat those 5 items and wait forever for anyone to pay attention to you. Go to Churrascaria Plataforma or Texas de Brazil instead of this place.",5.0,"Jul 16, 2022"

"What's that point of making a reservation if I still have to wait for nearly an hour to get seated? I made a reservation for 2:30PM in hopes to catch lunch, and still had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. I asked the front desk host for an ETA and she just told me to wait by the side for my name to be called. My friends approached her again shortly after to find out we were not even put on the list to be seated. Poor organization.

"""Gimme alll the meat here!""The is the place where you eat till you drop...dead...into a food coma. It's a carnivore's heaven, but they throw in a salad bar thing in case you wanna bring your vegetarian friend/family (you shouldn't though LOL). Or I guess, to cleanse your palette after eating too many servings of meat. (It helped.)Came here for an anniversary dinner, which was all around a wonderful dining experience. Loved the service, the patient and helpful waiters who stood still if we wanted to take pictures of their meat offerings, who asked what kind of thickness of meat we wanted, and when it seemed like we were waiting for a particular cut of meat (beef ribs!!) they asked and then a few minutes later, it was brought over to us. Yasss.First, the bread. Omg this cheese bread. I don't even know how many plates of bread we consumed (possibly on par with the meat) that's how good this cheesy mochi like treat was. Super stretchy, super cheesy, super filling. Super wanna smuggle plates of these homeIn terms of the meat cuts, my favorite is the beef rib. It's hands down the most tender of all the meats sampled, and has a really good meat-to-fat ratio that makes me salivate just thinking about eating it again. Next is the perfectly cooked and juicy lamb chops. I normally don't care for lamb chops because it does get a little gamey if not done right, but these were grilled perfectly with a perfect blend of seasoning. 10/10 would come again and wear bigger pants (even though the place is realllly nice and fancy looking) when I've finished a two day salad cleanse.

"Excellent dinner for a group who loves to eat!! I came here for my birthday dinner and didn't eat all day to get as much as I can out of this place! The all you can eat option comes with access to the salad bar and unlimited cheese bread, polenta, and fried plantains. I'd recommend not filling up on those apps as delicious as they are and holding out for the meat! They serve on rotation probably 10 or more different cuts in different temperatures. My favorite is the picanha, the fat cap makes for a super juicy and almost sweet like meat cooked at a perfect medium rare. The waiters also come by with grilled cheese in a honey like marinade and crisp bacon. Oooooh my mouth is salivating just typing this out so I think I'll end it here hahaha",5.0,"Feb 12, 2023"

"Now let me explain to you that the idea that this is BOTTOMLESS PRIME BRAZILIAN MEATS with endless sides for $45!!! A must go to for a special occasion. This is a go to spot for friends and I ever since i spent my 29th there a year ago & must of been here 6 times in that span. This lunch we went for a friend's birthday lunch and wanted to try a few other items, so HERES THE SCOOP...I always go for lunch (before 430p) since the Churrasco experience is $45 instead of $70. We tried the jumbo shrimp cocktail ($25) marinated in garlic sauce. The shrimp was delicious. It was slightly over cooked but the salsa dip was delicious and the garlic gave it so much flavor. The churrasco experience is amazing! They come to your table and slice the meat for you at the cooked temp of your liking (Med, well done). We ordered mash potatoes and they were cold, but the waiter quickly replaced it with fresh hot mash. The fried polenta is one of my favorite side dishes. But let's not talk about the cheese bread they give for the table and the fried bananas. YES fried bananas ! Not maduros. We had some salad, cheese, peppers etc for our plates to enjoy with the meat that came around. The waiters don't overwhelm you with options all at once which is nice because every meat is a fresh sliced piece. We had lamb chops, top sirloin , bottom sirloin, rib eye, lamb steak, and more! We also decided to try a Brazilian non alcoholic drink called pineapple mint lemonade. TO DIE FOR!  just ask for light ice to get your buck's worth even though it was about $4 (old barista hack). We were even dressed in jeans and a nice top. I wouldn't suggest walking in here in sweats but it's also upscale enough to celebrate a nice occasion and dress up on a night out. I recommend to make reservations especially since it's limited dining in NYC. But to sum it up, if your in a  carnivorous mood and want an all you can eat in midtown NYC for a steal of a  price, make a call",4.0,"Mar 26, 2021"

"This review is based on take out for restaurant week which btw has been extended until Feb 28th. Restaurant week is a perfect opportunity to try some of the best places your city has to offer without breaking the bank. It also allows you the opportunity to try new things you may never had the opportunity to, or perhaps under your radar but not within an allowable price range. BTW meals at participating restaurants are semi pre-selected at $20.21 which is phenomenal!!!!!The take out process is awesome. Especially, if you are not yet comfortable dining out but still want to support restaurant and want to have delicious meals. What did we order for pick up? I selected the steak and chicken with a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. The meal also comes with Brazilian cheese bread & the amazing chimi sauce. My husband ordered the lamb and steak combo with a potato salad & a caprese salad. His meal was accompanied by Brazilian cheese bread, chimi sauce, & mint jelly. Each meal was just $20.21 for restaurant week. This by far is a top phenomenal deal. The food was absolutely delightful!!! There are more options when you visit the restaurant week website. Please do not forget to tip kindly.  They also have lovely out door seating and I believe this weekend limited, indoor seating resumes.  Call in advance for further information. The take out is so nicely packaged. You will definitely enjoy your meal.",5.0,"Feb 13, 2021"
"**COVID LIMITED INDOOR DINING REVIEW**TL; DR: I am not exaggerating when I say that my visit to Fogo was one of THE BEST restaurant experiences I have EVER HAD. I am a proud, self-proclaimed Foodie/Brunch Queen (haha) so this is saying ALOT! My boyfriend had made a rez for the Saturday night before Valentine's Day PRIOR to the announcement that NYC's indoor dining would resume that same Friday...Needless to say, we weren't quite sure what to expect (complete madness?!) and hoped for the best. To say the experience exceeded our expectations would be an understatement. When we arrived we were promptly seated downstairs, and while the restaurant was completely booming, all of the tables were distanced and staff wore masks and gloves. (We were temp checked and required to wear a mask throughout the restaurant, as well.)I can't remember our servers name but I was taken by how genuinely HAPPY AND PLEASANT ALL OF THE STAFF WAS! It was evident that this wasn't an act, and that everyone was simply happy to be back among the NYC dining community. (I even joked with one of the staff members who brought our drinks over, and he was so cheerful and expressed how he was just happy to be back at work!) This sentiment truly resonated throughout the building and created the best environment for our first time eating out in a while! Now, THE FOOD...*wipes drool* I made sure to eat super lightly all day to preserve my appetite, and boy, am I glad that I did! Everything was absolutely delicious. Seriously. I also appreciated that the salad bar/buffet was manned by a staff member who worked around and served us, to avoid tons of ppl reaching over (and possibly cross contaminating) the food during COVID-19! This put my mind more at ease, and this food was equally DELISH!I don't know when, but we'll be returning to Fogo as soon as humanly possible. My boyfriend is absolutely hooked now (after his second Brazilian Steakhouse experience). I am relieved to see that Fogo weathered the [pandemic] storm, with so many other restaurants shuttering, and will absolutely be a customer for a long time to come!THANK YOU FOGO, for such a memorable and incredible experience! :-)",5.0,"Mar 9, 2021"

"Fogo de Chao has been on my radar for quite some time and I finally got the chance to try it. I want to first start by saying that the atmosphere of this restaurant is incredible and has a very elegant feel to it. The service was exceptional as well and they really nailed the AYCE system here with the circle cards (green side for more food, and red side to pause). As soon as the card gets flipped green, meats will be coming to your table every minute or two. They had a good arrangement of meats from beef, lamb, chicken, and pork. Although there were a few good cuts of meat, most of the leaner ones were tough and on the dry side. I also felt that most of the meats were lacking in flavor, mostly just salty. The salad bar was quite nice though and acted as a great palette cleanser after being fatigued from the meats. I loved the assortment of fresh greens and fruit and found myself returning for more pretty often.It was a good experience to try, but at this price point I don't think I'd return for seconds.",3.0,"Jan 12, 2022"

Knowing how it works, my husband and I went to the salads etc. table in case there's something worth having before we start enjoying the steaks. I ended up enjoying some cured meats, cheese, and smoked salmon. And I discovered something new this time, their bacon. You guys, their brown sugar and black pepper is incredibly yum! Like you will try to keep yourself from coming for more level! I had to restrain myself from having more since I obviously wanted to go for what we came for, the Brazilian steaks! That being said, I've tried almost every cut but I always enjoy the Picanha the most! The filet mignon, bottom sirloin and pork sausage are the other cuts that I can highly recommend.We were also given a few slides: Brazilian cheese bread, mashed potato and fried banana, but I didn't touch any of those carbs. Since we chose to skip alcohol, we tried a diet versión of a Brazilian soda which we actually liked. Overall, we definitely had an excellent time and certainly won't be the last. It's the best place if you want to eat some delicious steaks but pace out how you want to indulge. I actually managed to lose a pound the day after so it's definitely a win-win!P.S It's beside MOMA so for those visiting, you can definitely plan seeing both the museum and having a great meal here!",4.0,"Mar 28, 2022"
I did want to give an update on my last review and thank management for getting in touch and resolving the issue. I was able to visit again this past weekend for dinner and had a very positive experience. Food was great and the service was even better. Love the South American cocktails.,1.0,"Feb 12, 2022"
The food was amazing!  Unfortunately the service by the waiters for drinks and dessert was subpar. I always had to flag someone down when my wine was empty.  I also left a shopping bag from lululemon on the chair at our table and realized it was missing after they closed.  I came back in the morning to grab it and they said that there was nothing found.  We were one of the last parties that were in the dining room when we left at 11pm so i'm not sure how it could have gone missing.  Really disappointed by this but the food was fantastic.,3.0,"Dec 3, 2022"

"+ Reservations, reservations, reservations. Be sure to make reservations before going as there may be a long wait without one.+ The main dining area is in the basement. If you would like a quiet dining experience with less people, ask to be seated in the second floor. There is also booth seating on the second floor. The downside is that the salad bar and constant foot traffic of servers is in the basement. The elevator is available to pick up food from the salad bar which is a slight inconvenience. Also, the flow of servers with meat seemed to be less on the second floor, but not to the point where we need to search for the servers.+ The alcohol cart that is rolled around and served is not complimentary! The servers will try and entice you to take a drink, but keep in mind, there is a cost. On that note, I totally recommend the pineapple drink that cleanses and flushes the meat, that feels stuck in your chest, down to your stomach.",4.0,"Apr 26, 2022"
"Over all was a great experience though it should be meant to note that this is my first Brazilian Steakhouse experience.Service and ambiance was phenomenal. Service was gracefully strategic and the food was very good. You can stay for as long as you like, no to go boxes and leftovers seems to be a nonissue. Quality of meat is definitely noted, it was good. The taste however aren't hitting too much into the spot. Taste is good and decent, it is definitely not bad. Though if you pay around $75 for the experience- which means as much meat as you can devour, it is justifiable.The experience include the entire salad bar, all the meat cuts identified on the menu, they are served with plantains, mashed potatoes and polenta.",5.0,"Mar 4, 2021"
"My friends and I had the Fogo Churrasco experience. It was absolutely an amazing experience. The place was very fancy and elegant and provided delicious meals. Service was well organized. The experience includes Market Table and Brazilian side dishes. From appetizers to desserts, definitely recommended course meals in new york city. Got to celebrate for my birthday here. You should check it out if there's any occasional events going on for your special ones. Thumbs up :)",5.0,"Jan 15, 2021"
"We had date night here last Saturday, first outdoor dining in a minute for us, and we were excited! I took my blanket with me as I didn't want the weather, distracting me from the food, but that wasn't necessary as we had two heaters per table and 2 fresh sealed blankets were handed to us. We decided on the Fogo churrasco experience, and that was a smart and delightful option, it's basically a continuous table side service of signature cuts of fire roasted meat, my favorites were the pork ribs, rib eye and the chicken. Oh my! Quite tasty, needless to say, the hubs and I were STUFFED, but very happy and warm. Rodrigo was our server and he was on top of things.",5.0,"Apr 15, 2022"
"Took our daughter out to dinner before our concert and we choose this restaurant for she never had Brazilian and We have never been to this restaurant. Everything was absolutely amazing, delicious and fresh. Our server Tania was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. The rest of the staff were great also.

"I had the best dining experience here. The atmosphere/decor is classy and not overdone. The COVID precautions were very modern and thorough. My husband made a reservation for us two for dinner. We got the ""Fogo experience"" where you receive unlimited cuts of meat and the market table. Upon checking-in, they asked for one of us to complete our address and name on an iPad and then proceeded to have our temperature checked by a separate iPad.The cuts of meat were amazing and the customer service was impeccable - staff was super attentive but not annoying. The drinks were strong but delicious - my favorite was the Caramelized Pineapple Old Fashion. The price for the food is pre-fixed at $70 per person, not including drinks or anything else. There doesn't appear to be a dress code as my husband was wearing sneakers and sportswear. You will see a mixed crowd which is nice and unpretentious. Due to our amazing experience, we will be back to this restaurant in the future.",5.0,"Dec 17, 2022"

"4 stars for the incredible Restaurant Month deal ($39 pp) and those glorious caramelized bacon strips, omg.I managed to book a 6:45pm table for Friday night, the last night of Restaurant WEEK ($42 pp) - this was the original plan until we were told that Restaurant Month is essentially the same, just no dessert, and we could make our decision after our main course. Shoutout to the flexibility! We ended up being way too stuffed for dessert (though we were offered to pack our desserts to go, again very nice of them) which was going to be like a cheese cake or chocolate cake... no thanks. Was happy to cap the night overstuffed from the unlimited meats & salad bar for only $39 (+tax and tip)!I had been to the Philadelphia location once before, about 2 years ago, so I knew what to expect -- a crazy salad bar (Market Table), sides, and nonstop meats. I was SO excited and prepared all day by eating super light. I was ready.My boyfriend kept trying to wean me off of carbs during the meal since he believed our stomachs should've been 99% meats that night, but I just couldn't do it. Those warm cheese breads to start? I had like 3. The rice & beans? So delicious (don't remember having this in Philly). The caramelized bananas? YUM. The Market Table was also amaaaazing - from smoked salmon to green beans to tomato mozzarella to various fruits...  I wish I had more space in my stomach to return, but one plate was more than enough.Now let's talk about that bacon. I'm usually not a huge fan of bacon, but I've heard great things about this brown sugar and black pepper bacon. We each grabbed a couple of slices, returned to our table and took a bite at the exact same time. We just stared into each other's eyes, stunned. This was the best piece of bacon I'd ever had -- perfect mix of sweet + savory; something I could snack on all day. It tasted like jerky but also like kettle corn. Twas spectacular.As for the star of the night, the continuous tableside service of fire-roasted meat... it was lackluster at most, disappointing. Pretty much all of the cuts were way too salty for my palette. Maybe the pork ribs were the only thing that wasn't so bad. Texture + temperature of the (medium) meats were good, just again overly salted. If I had to pay full price for this experience ($68?), definitely would NOT be worth it. Service was nice, accommodating and attentive though. Would only recommend during Restaurant Week / Month.",4.0,"Aug 19, 2019"
"This is somewhere between a 4 and a 5 for me, but rounded down only because it was a to-go order and steak is best enjoyed right away. I've actually been here before for restaurant week in person and it's phenomenal. Our first restaurant week outing this year was to try the amazing $20.21 deal at Fogo de Chao. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size. You get your choice of two meats and two sides. Plus they give you two pieces of pao de queijo and sauces to accompany the meats. We chose to try the lamb and top sirloin. The meat itself was delicious- tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned. They wrapped each meat up in foil to keep it warm, which was much appreciated. The steak came with a yummy chimichurri sauce. The lamb came with a mint jelly that I didn't really care for. The meats were sliced, but not all the way through, so it was hard to fully detach the slices with the plastic dinnerware. The pao de queijo was really good, but cold. Had we been able to eat it straight out of the oven, it would have been even better. We got mashed potatoes which were perfection- rich and creamy and topped with scallions for some freshness. Our second side was caesar salad, which was just okay, but you don't come here for the salad. All in all, it was a spectacular deal and a really good meal. If you can, stop by this month to take advantage of the reduced price point at this fantastic steakhouse.",4.0,"Jan 31, 2021"
"First time, but not the last!What a delight this place is!  We stopped after a visit to the museum and were both pretty hungry.  The ambiance is very high class and chill.  You usually go down a lovely staircase to the main dining area, where you order your drinks, and then begin with the salad bar (depending on what you order).The salad bar offers an array of non-traditional items as well as a nice selection of meats and cheeses.  I went light on this as I was preparing to get some meat in my belly!  Wow, the meat was all well prepared and it just keeps coming til you are done!  I tried it all and ended up with the meat sweats (yay)!For drinks, I had the brazillian bloody mary and it was delicious.  I would also recommend the flan for dessert.  I've had a lot of flan, but none as good as this in both consistency and flavor!I'll definitely be back to this location!",4.0,"Oct 15, 2019"
"They are COVID ready with outdoor dining and takeout.  We happen to order takeout during restaurant week so we really lucked out. The steaks were cooked just right. Juicy and tender.

Asparagus were tender and not over cooked.  The soup was yummy.  The portions we big!  The restaurant was elegance inside. Can't wait to return and sit down!",4.0,"Feb 13, 2021"

Also there is a spicy honey drizzled grilled cheese that is desert level quality and a true stand out by way of flavor diversity and new to my Churrasco Experience, though that did not prevent us from wrapping the meal with an amazing Crème Brûlée which did not disappoint either! 5 of 5 stars, thank you Fogo for a wonderful dinner able to be shared with a dear friend!",5.0,"Feb 26, 2022"

"An almost absolutely exquisite brunch experience. I have heard of Fogo de Chão from a couple of friends of mine who highly recommended it and I can see why. If you are new to Brazilian style steakhouses I suggest coming to this one first for its top notch quality and value.The first thing you got to know about Brazilian steakhouses is that all the food is ""shared around."" What I mean by this is that, instead of ordering your steak and having your meal served to you, all the waiters walk around with already cooked meat on skewers. You are given a ""medallion"" (which is really just a coaster) that says the meat you ordered and if you flip it over to green then waiters come over to slice some meat for you. It's a really fun and quick way to get your meal. Instead of waiting for one dish it's already floating around you waiting for the chance to land on your plate! What is also nice about this setup is that you more or less get unlimited meat to eat! When I was here for the brunch buffet I got a few things from the buffet bar, like pineapples and cheese, then I just kept filling my small plate with meat when it emptied. I think the front desk said you can use the ""medallion"" for up to an hour or something but by the time the hour is up you will probably be bursting with steak. This is quality steak too, especially if you order the Picanha or ""prime sirloin."" With that in mind I think the brunch buffet here is a really great value for a high end steakhouse.The service when I was here was pretty great as well. I suppose people don't regularly come to steakhouses for a weekday brunch so the place wasn't too packed. I was seated quickly, I got my orders in quickly and all the meat I wanted came pretty quickly too. The waiters and staff seemed in good spirits when I spoke to them and were more then willing to explain the setup since I didn't know at first what I was doing. Kudos to the staff for making this experience even better! There is a reason if you google ""Brazilian steakhouse"" Fogo de Chão comes up as the second result. It really deserves that spot. The service, the food and the price all make it worth coming. Next time I am here I will be sure to try out there other meats.",5.0,"May 5, 2023"

"What a mixed bag. The food was delicious but ultimately undone by a friendly waitstaff that seemingly forgot we existed. I understand being short staffed during these times but that didn't appear to be the case as there seemed to be as many waiters as diners. Now, my friend did love the meats and there were plenty of fresh vegetarian options at the salad bar. Although the meats came in quick succession, our waitstaff forgot to visit our table for long stretches and it took ages to order dessert, get another drink, and ask for the check. Also, my favorite item -  the cheese bread - was often delivered cold. Making matters worse was that I had mentioned my friend's birthday when making a reservation. The gentleman on the phone made a note and said that a special dessert would be delivered. I'm neither picky nor demanding, but it did feel odd to await something that just never came. The desserts that we did order were delicious.Staff were friendly and courteous, but the lasting impression is of having felt neglected and unimportant. A shame given the high quality of food and excellent ambiance. I'd definitely return, but not for a special ocassion. At a $100 per head without alcohol, you definitely do expect a more premium experience.",3.0,"Oct 23, 2021"

"A fun delivery alternative!! To be perfectly honest, I was just craving their pao de queijo (cheese bread/ popover) it's so addictive that - like a pillow with a yummy cheesy center. I felt it was wrong to order bread without steak from a steakhouse- granted this is my favorite steakhouse usuallyThe tabbouleh was fresh, you can tell it was made the same day and quinoa was cooked properly. In terms of the steak- I will be honest- I ordered medium and got medium well... something tells me putting hot /cooked meat in a foil and delivering it will keep it cooking in transit- but it was good, seasoning was lacking though. Mashed potatoes were good though on the heavier side, it was dense, I prob would order something else next time.",4.0,"Mar 2, 2020"
"The food is the standard Fogo meat feast so that was good.  The only detractor was the service which was mediocre at best and pretty absent at worst.  We literally had to flag down our server to get refills on sides and try to chase down a gaucho to even get meat brought over (yes the cards were on ""green"").  Part of the issue is that we were seated along on the side on the lower level - but to be honest, that should not have warranted being ignored.  It was pretty busy too on a Saturday but definitely not ideal to sit for over 10 minutes waiting for a server.  The gauchos seemed a bit over-worked to be honest and, like others here mentioned, pretty unhappy.  I would conjecture that under-staffing on a busy weekend is definitely a root cause and recommend that the management look more into this.  I did also notice that there was a very HARD push on upsell - we were pushed to get the Wagyu immediately (""we highly recommend this and just know that this is the only item you can take home"") and an entire bottle of Malbec after we were told that they were out of the glass serving.  Without this ""strong hint"", we would have likely gotten both but the pushiness definitely stopped us from doing so.  A cold, reheated Wagyu should definitely not be the goal and to use the ""take home"" rationale is pretty off-putting...Some overall tips and highlights:1. While the picanha is the heralded featured cut, I would recommend starting off by asking the servers or gauchos to swing by when they have the costelo (beef ribs) or ancho (rib-eye ready) - I found those to be the most flavorful and juiciest cuts.  Since they don't come in plenty supply, make sure you grab multiple servings when they come by.  Trust me on this.2. The filet is decently tender but not very flavorful - get a serving to try but I left it at that.  Same with the bacon-wrapped variant.3. The parmesan pork loin is definitely worth trying but it is very heavy and filling so save that for the end.4. The lamb steak is another must-try: flavorful, tender, and with the perfect hint of mint.  This is another hard to find cut so let the servers know that you would like it to be brought over as soon as they have the next round.5. All of the sides are good but the pao de quejo is definitely the one to get.  They are light, fluffy, and flavorful - try them paired with the butternut squash soup as a ""palette cleanser"" between meat courses.  The mashes potatoes are also solid but heavy so save them for the end.6. The candied bacon is very solid - flavorful, crispy, and the perfect blend of sweet, smoky, and savory.  Be sure to grab a few slices!7. The chocolate brigadeiro is basically a version of a chocolate cheesecake mousse - creamy and dense enveloped by a robe of chocolate sauce.  It's big enough to share and definitely worth saving room for.  In fact, all of the desserts looked very solid!",3.0,"Dec 7, 2020"
"Most of the servers were nice.  The ambiance was beautiful.  I have no problem paying for high quality food .  However this is definitely quantity over quality.

The issue was remedied with giving me some more muscles and some shrimp - I wasn't thrilled with the trade off but it is what it is.

"Today 07/15/2022, I had the most horrible experience at this particular fogo de chao location and it will forever leave a very bad taste in my mouth!!. This review is based off on the terrible, Rude, customer service I experienced from the so called manager on duty by name ""DANTE"". Guys! Stay away from this place if this miserable man still works there or be prepared to have your day/night ruined.The night started off good , with myself and a friend. The waiter was friendly and the cashier was also pleasant. We had the ""EXPERIENCE"".  I had loved the ""grilled cheese with honey"" and when I requested to have some, the waiter told me it will be coming out in 5 minutes! 5 minutes turned out to be a over 30 minutes wait and mind you this was past 11pm and we were ready to leave. However, the waiter was kind enough to compensate us for the delay by offering us the option to take the grilled cheese ""to go"" if we want. She had then stepped away for a minute. I then saw another worker and asked the man politely if we could get a to-go pack because we wanted to take the grilled cheese.? The Man was so rude and aggressive explaining to me ""how because we ordered the experience meal, NO FOOD IS ALLOWED TO GO""- I TRIED EXPLAINING TO HIM THE SITUATION, about how its a ""compensated 'TO GO' after the longg wait, he insisted that it wouldn't be happening! At that point I asked for his name, and to my dismay - he told me rudely that his name is ""DANTE, one of the 'MANAGERS', and he went on to say to me- ""you free to call whoever or whatever you want to do, but that is the policy and that's it! He took the grilled cheese off the table without even asking if we were finished! I was so disgusted at the so called manager's behavior! How is this man even a  ""Manager ""??! . He has absolutely No customer Service skills whatsoever ! He was condescending and just all round distasteful! Today will be the last day I ever visit this restaurant!!

I give this establishment a 9/10. Booked a table for me & 12 guest on. Saturday Night in March of 2022. Food was great. Service was great too. The only thing. On Saturday Nights they need more staff to help out with the drink. The drinks my guest & I ordered took some time before they can be delivered. I visited the Location in Roosevelt Long Island.,4.0,"Oct 14, 2019"
"Calling all meat lovers- Fogo de Chao is a Brazilian steakhouse with unlimited meat, fruit, and salad options. There is a huge dining room in the ground floor and a bar in the check in area. Our server, Ashley, was not the friendliest nor helpful server but it was a busy night- probably tired. The meats at Fogo de Chao are quality meats but over salted. The wagyu however was perfectly cooked and came to our table on a salt block. The servers for all the meats were professional, took the time to find the right doneness, and came to our table just with eye contact. I would say the buffet is the better option (unless you are pescatarian or have other dietary restrictions) because the buffet station offers additional choices such as fruits, salads, lox, and charcuterie.",4.0,"Jul 24, 2021"
I came for my 1st time on a Friday after work. To start when I walked in I loved the decorum of this restaurant.  Very nice. I had a 615pm reservation but arrived at 545pm so I decided to get some happy hour drinks. The cucumber mint smash was amazing. A refreshing cool after work cocktail. The mango Habanero was also Very good.  The bartender was attentive and served me and my guest right away. At 610pm I checked in to get my table and was seated right away. The hostess was pleasant.We get to the table and our server came to us immediately.  I didn't even get a chance to sit down yet. Lol. But I thought that was great service.The salad bar was good. A nice variety of selections and tasty. Now for the meat selection. The bacon wrapped filet was oh so good. The picana was seasoned and tender. The garlic sirloin also very good. The lamb another amazing taste of meat. The pork rib lacked seasoning and flavor but was tender. Never got to try any beef ribs. Was very disappointed. It would have been 5 starts but there was one server who had the filet and picana but he kept passing us by although we had the green side up. We had to stop him every time. Felt intentional but again I did not let it ruin everything else that was good.I will definitely be back.,4.0,"Mar 31, 2019"
Fogo is always a good time with a group. There were 8 of us and We tasted everything offered. Service was good and the meats kept coming. Cold bar is always yummy and drinks were good. And the service was good. Looking forward to the next time.,5.0,"Oct 6, 2021"
"One of my all time favorite restaurants. Decided to hit up this place with some friends after comiccon.Food: I've been to this location exactly 3 times. My first Fugo experience was actually in Brazil. Sometimes the meat is done to perfection and sometimes the meat is a little too rare. The flavor is always on point though.Price: I would round up to maybe $70 per person. Not a bad price for a night out in NYC. I feel it is justified based on the quality of meat.  Service:  Service is a hit and miss. I had on point service from this chain and I've had service where the waitress looked lost. Parking: $$$ cause its NYC. Fun Note: Once upon a time in Brazil, they had told me they only Brazilian natives to work at Fugo. Don't know if this still applies but that was 10+ years ago.",4.0,"Nov 4, 2018"
"Honestly all you can eat steak? A must try. This place does it in such a way! The seasoning isn't overpowering the meat you're consuming. It compliments so well. There is bacon wrapped chicken and sirloin. They also have a traditional buffet with like fruits and cheeses and salads. The service is always amazing. I've been several times, pre and post covid, same amazing service. My suggestion is to go empty stomach and try as much as you can! Dont over pile the plate because its so much better hot!",5.0,"Aug 12, 2021"
"Top notch Brazilian steakhouse. The place is refined indoor and outdoor. The food is to die for, off the wall. Rodizio is a must at Brazilian restaurants, the variety available is astonishing. There is so much to choose from, all top quality. You can't keep up with all the choices in front of you. Every single plate I tasted delectable. I'd love to have a second stomach to be able to try all of this amazing food. All meats are cooked to perfection. Smokey flavor on the meats and the salad bar had everything I could think of. Service was incredible, all of our waiters and bus boys were super attentive to all of our needs. Highly recommended. The dessert and drinks are very good too.

The place is huge and has different levels and even a lounge area. We did the salad bar and meat option. The salad bar alone is amazingggg! Since we were starving after the show, we kind of went a little crazy. By the time we were ready for the meats we were slowing down. All different options, cooking styles, etc. Also came with bread and sides. Even though we had no more room, since they knew we came for my birthday they brought out a dessert and sang quickly.

I was pleasantly surprised by the plentiful and various meat cuts they provided. They came around pretty often too! I'd recommend saving your stomach and skipping the chicken cuts. My fave were the sirloins. Overall, the meat quality wasn't something extraordinary but worth trying at least once. The ambiance and service were great. Also got a free birthday dessert which was the perfect way to end the experience!",5.0,"Jul 22, 2020"

"Sometimes you just want steak. If that's the case Fogo de chao nyc is serving up all the meats. I definitely suggest getting the whole experience. You can start off with the salad bar buffet, and by the time you head back to the table appetizers will be waiting (polenta, plaintains, mashed potatoes, and cheesy bread) For the entree the waitstaff just keeps coming back with different cuts, until you turn your coaster from green to red. We were so busy trying to keep up with the waitstaff we barely kept track of what was on our plate and even forgot to take pictures. We were so stuffed we had to pass on dessert. Make sure you come ready to eat! The experience is $70/pp w/out drinks and dessert.",5.0,"Aug 2, 2021"

The reservation was in my name, and the hostess only acknowledged by partner. She led us to the dining area, pulled out HIS chair and left me standing. Our server, though pleasant-kept interrupting us and asked what we wanted to eat before we could look at the menu or order a drink. I thought she was trying to ""flip the table"" but the dining area was packed. We left feeling a bit disregarded and at a loss.

"Brought my sister here for what I was planning to be a quick dinner (quiet celebration for her belated birthday). What I didn't expect was that we'd have such a great time and would end up dining in for nearly 3 hours. I've been to other Fogo locations before, and especially as a then-broke college student, I remember how fondly my friends and I would recall our rare but beloved Fogo meals in Boston. This was my first time returning to Fogo as a working adult (business unprofessional), but this experience was truly memorable. I cannot emphasize how fantastic the service was - staff was warm, attentive, and kept the experience light. The food was flavorful and delicious, but for me, what really brought this experience from 4-star to 5 was the service.

"I visited Fogo de Chão during restaurant week with my brother and some friends. I have eaten at many restaurants that serve rodizio, and Fogo de Chão was way overpriced!The restaurant itself is very nice, but that's to be expected for something that is with restaurant week. The rodizio menu is limited if you get the restaurant week special. You also receive dessert. The limited rodizio selection is about as diverse as the lunch selection at similar rodizio restaurants, but at twice the price.The majority of the meats were cooked to medium, not my preferred medium rare, but they were pretty average compared to other rodizio places. I enjoyed their leg of lamb and top sirloin the most. Service was pretty slow, we often found ourselves simply waiting for people with skewers to show up to the table.

After being served dessert, we were ignored until once again having to flag someone down for the bill.

"Fogo is the definitive Churrascaria experience in the U.S., and while the New York location is not bad, I think the Beverly Hills location is better. Fogo is one of those bucket list restaurants for all carnivores, you need to try it at least once if you like meat. While the variety may be appealing the first few times you do Brazilian BBQ, you'll quickly hone in on a few cuts that you like more than others. You'll also notice that some cuts are way juicier and tender than others. In any case, know that you can ORDER the cut of meat you want and they will bring it to you, instead of waiting for a cut to come around!!!My favorites are lamb chop, beef rib, and picanha, so I just end up eating those 3 cuts. The beef rib is a MUST, but it rarely comes around, so be sure to order it for your table as soon as you get there! It is more tender than texas BBQ style beef ribs, albeit less spicy and salty.",5.0,"Mar 13, 2021"
"Buckle up we're going to be reading for a while. Following a night at Mastro's, we came here for the first time.  I've always heard so many great things about Fogo De Chao, but this just didn't match up to the things I've heard. We were originally seated downstairs and ultimately started to decide to leave based on the menu. The server approached and we discussed possibilities of leaving due to menu portions and not fully understanding we did have the options for smaller entrees, the server proceeded to pour bottled water, which customers are charged for. We end up reseating and are served food. The steaks were overly salted and dry. We asked for medium well (under advisory that it would be slight pink in the middle) and got well done.  As you can see from the picture, the steak is dry and the edges are extremely dried out as well. One of them is actually somewhat curled up. The waiter we had offered a replacement, which was declined, and ultimately brought out another steak. This was better but it was more medium than medium well. (We did eat this one) The more I ate the mashed potatoes, the more they tasted like Banquet mashed potatoes. The complimentary cheese bread was rather questionable. It was very spongelike and oddly textured. We also had spinach dip which was okay but we were brought a big bowl and less than a handful of bread to scoop it with. The restaurant tried their best to accommodate so there's no issue there but how does a steakhouse mess up the one thing they are known for.... three times in a row? I've had better steaks from Waffle House. Fix. It.",5.0,"Dec 22, 2022"

"Meattttttt. I've been here three times now in the past three years, and it's been fun and coma-inducing every time. I'd recommend taking advantage of this place during restaurant week. You definitely save a lot and get a lot in return. Atmosphere: large, bars at the top and dining room at the bottom. Reservations recommended.Food: during restaurant week, I think they limit the menu only a little bit so you're not getting filet mignon or prime sirloin. No biggie though, I feel. Let me speak to the wonder that is their salad bar (they call it market table). It's is plentiful, full of fresh fruits and veggies, charcuterie to die for, and things that you wouldn't expect, like smoked salmon. I LOVE their chicken salad, it's like a mixture of chicken and veggies in a light mayo or aioli sauce. They also had this delicious butternut squash salad (i believe that is seasonal cause i didn't see it the last time i came) that had feta in it. I also love their roasted eggplants and asparagus. They also had a yummy yucca soup, and their black beans with bits of steak is tasty.All the rodizio meats are solid. They give you the option of choosing how well you want the steak and they cut the piece for you. And they're really generous with how much they give. I truly enjoy the pork sausage (super juice and flavorful) and the top sirloin (esp medium rare). The lamb is a little too gamey for me. Beef ribs are plentiful and juicy. Also, can't go wrong with bacon wrapped steak. Also, the side dishes. Like, damn. Pao de queijo are these little warm soft cheesy airy bread balls. They are so damn good and fluffy and addicting. The polenta fries are good and crispy. Not too swooned by the garlic mashed potatoes, but only because they're 100% smooth, and I like mine to still have bits of potato in the mix. The caramelized bananas are soft and really, really sweet.Desserts are just okay, but who's coming for that, right? Service: fantastic, you're never wondering where the food is and our waiter was attentive and checked on us often, even asking if we were waiting on specific meats. They also provided a bigger dessert to us during restaurant week since it was my birthday :) Solid place. Fun experience. Just make sure you don't food coma on the way out.",5.0,"Apr 16, 2022"

"One of the few Brazillian steak houses in new york. Had to try out the Churascaria experience. It's situated in a large space next to a hotel so you'll have a expansive view of the eating area as it's 2 levels. Service was nice as you brought over the different cuts of meat. A card is provided with a red side and green side. Red means no more meat and green means keep it coming. You start off with a salad bar which has many different items. Standouts were the marinated mushrooms, the papaya and melon, the large fresh wheel of parmesean, the charcuterie of salami and cheeses, and the artichokes. They also give you complimentary cheese bread, fried polenta, and fried bananas. All were deliscious. I loved the 3 items which really make a great pre dinner snack.The meats were plentiful. Chicken thigh and leg, bottom steak, and top steak, sausage, and Brazilian style cut of steak. I particularly liked the bottom steak which had nice char and flavor. They cut it to your liking, a more medium outer cut or a more rare inner cut. The showmanship is great as they cut it right in front of you onto your plate with large knifes. It's definitely a experience. Dessert standouts were the cheesecake which was very smooth. It's a bit pricey at $65 and during restaurant week $45 but i'd definitely bring friends or family here.

"MehI found the food to be over-seasoned (actually gave me some major indigestion after the meal) and while I love my meat, it's just hard to justify spending so much on a mediocre meal. For the same cost of the pre-fix at Fogo De Chão I could have had a top notch, equally filling meal elsewhere in NYC. If you're into the chain thing, and also gorging yourself and prioritizing quantity over quality, then you'll love this. I must say, the staff here was excellent. Our servers were lovely and helpful. Only the guy hawking the lamb seemed sad and curt.",5.0,"Jan 5, 2023"
How can you say no to all you can eat! We made reservations for 7:45 and it took a little long to be seated. Came here for restaurant week $42 dinner is not a bad deal. My best friend and I came here and let me say all the meat we had was really good. Medium rare is the way to go. Definitely need reservations for this spot or you probably will never be seated for dinner time. Salad bar and steak is buffet style. Dont miss out on desert make sure you got some space for that as well. Highly recommended brazilian steakhouse. It was absolutely delicious and super filling. My friend and I was definitely in a steak coma from eat 2 hours of non stop steak haha. The wait was worth it.,3.0,"Apr 11, 2021"
"We were a party of six people and sat in the back near the wine inventory. The table was set nicely for us as we had made a reservation for 7pm. We were served by Anderson, a very talent server, who would be attentive to us and another six top near us. We all selected the $64 menu option and the meats were excellent, we were all happy with the experience. Anderson is very knowledgeable in the Fogo de Chao menu and the types of drinks. He offered two drinks to two members of our party and they both enjoyed them. Overall it was a great night and we enjoyed ourselves alot at Fogo de Chao. Will be back for more!",2.0,"Oct 7, 2019"

"Brazilian steakhouses have risen in popularity in the last 5 years or so, popping up in malls, suburbs, and of course, big city locations like midtown Manhattan. Fogo de Chao in NYC is in the heart of Manhattan, very close to Rockefeller and many corporate offices. All-you-can-eat meats at a high-quality restaurant is the standard in a hub filled with tourists and high profile professionals.The first Brazilian steakhouse i've ever gone to was in Dallas, Texas, which was actually the first US city to have such a restaurant. I was captivated by the variety of meats offered, and needless to say I was contently stuffed!Since I had gone to a few Brazilian steakhouses before Fogo in NYC, I've had an internal benchmark in my head about my expectations.Overall, this Fogo satisfies me in essentially all ways that all steakhouses of this kind does. However, I have gotten the sense that they do not offer as much of a variety of different steaks and other meats as I remember from other Brazilian steakhouses like Rafain in Dallas, and Texas de Brazil in other locations. This doesn't stop me from loving this place and making it a top choice on my list for places to indulge, but I'd say that I've had better in the past.",4.0,"Dec 8, 2019"
"I love fogo de chao! I have dined here several times and have definitely taken up the restaurant week offers pre covid. I have always had an amazing meal and look forward to my visits. First off there are unlimited options from the salad bar which is nice to have some lighter options in between your meals. The PÃO DE QUEIJO (soft cheesy bread) melts in your mouth, and the mashed potatoes and bananas are also delicious! The meat options are endless and while some pieces of the cut may vary in term of seasoning, I still enjoy my experience and the food! Not to mention the chocolate cake is heaven!!!",5.0,"Mar 2, 2021"

Foods were delicious and, I'd say, classy (even its complementary sauce was made of chopped parsley in olive oil, wow). It's customer service was also superb! So lovely a place.

"I've been wanting to come to this steakhouse for such a long time and when my husband said that our friends were making plans for a Sunday couples' brunch here, I was ecstatic! I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't sure if we were going to get the full churrascaria 'meat parade' experience but it didn't matter.When we arrived, everyone was at the bar waiting for us. We were late because parking was a nightmare (see note). We all ordered a cocktail and waited to be seated. I started off with one of their grapefruit gin drinks which I found to be a bit too sweet but I'm sure the bartender could adjust it to your liking. She seemed more than capable and was very knowledgeable about their various available spirits.The place is grand with three floors. There is outdoor seating, coat check and a bar on the main, a dining area below and I believe a second one above. They also have restrooms on each floor. The hostess' were super accommodating. They saw that two of us couples had strollers and small children and asked us if we would prefer a larger table to accommodate the strollers, providing us with enough space where we didn't have to check the strollers and they set up highchairs for us. It's a plus that they have an elevator to the dining area which makes life so much easier. When our table was ready, we were escorted down to be seated and our server immediately approached, took our drink orders and welcomed us to enjoy the salad bar. I really wish I remembered his name because he was soooo helpful during our dining experience. Since we were here for brunch, they also had a waffle and omelet station in addition to the salad bar. There were plenty of greens, rice, beans, cheeses, charcuterie, salads and a soup special on display for our gluttony. I even asked for some chimichurri which I kept plateside, along with some of their pickled onions. We also received the signature mashed potatoes, candied bananas, yuca frites and pao de quiejo (cheese bread), which I love. The meat that we did get to try was amazing. When they finally did come around, I was able to sample their bottom sirloin, filet mignon, lamb, picanha and chicken. I usually find the chicken to be overdone and dried to death two times over but theirs was juicy and thoroughly enjoyable. Since we were a large group at a rectangular table, many of the gouchos seemed to only really go to the end diners and they wouldn't come to the rest of us so we were missing out on cuts of meat as they were flying by. I didn't even know they had lamb chops until someone on the end mentioned it and then I had to personally request that some be brought to me. I know there were at least three or four cuts of meat we didn't even get a chance to try because the gouchos either only went to the two diners on the end or cometely passed our table. I'm not sure if it was because we had the two kids or if it was just that there were so many of us that they didn't even want to bother. Either way it was a bit frustrating because we're paying the same as every other diner in the place, so I expect to receive the same experience. I will say that in my opinion, the best cut of meat is their filet mignon which I normally never order because of its lack of fat but in the case of Fogo, theirs was like butter. It was exceptionally good.I must mention that Jessica (manager?) was so sweet to all of us and very attentive to our needs. She came by often to check in on us, she escorted us up and down the elevator and she got me my lamb chops. Her demeanor, alone, made up for missing out on all the meats. Even our server went above and beyond the call of duty when my beautiful daughter spilled my soup all over the both of us (luckily only my kimono was sauced). It landed in my lap while I was holding her and he was very helpful in assisting me with tons upon tons of napkins and a paper bag for my soupy kimono. He didn't miss a beat and he kept asking if there was anything he could do. I could see on his face that he felt my pain and he was trying to do all he could to help make this little snag remain nothing more than that.I definitely want to come back here but we might have to leave the baby with my parents so we can enjoy the full dining experience without leaving the restaurant wearing any of our meal. Also, I think I'll be asking about the meats they offer before we even order our drinks so that I can request the specific cuts I would like to try. NOTE (as of 8/04/19): Even on a Sunday parking right now in the area is atrocious. There are many restrictions due to construction so make sure you read the signage because the construction signs supercede the regular daily signage and we narrowly missed getting what was sure to be a hefty ticket.",4.0,"Aug 7, 2019"

"I've been to Brazilian Steakhouses many times in the past so I knew what to expect at Fogo de Chao.  I've heard that the restaurant is pretty pricey so I was glad to take advantage of the Restaurant Week pricing.  I have to say, the place is HUGE with seating on three levels (the main level is a bar/seating area and I'm not so sure that the meats come to that level).  The decor is very nice and the music was fantastic - not too loud that you had to scream in order to have a conversation, but loud enough that you could enjoy it.  They have a pretty good selection at the salad bar, although I didn't try too many items in order to save my appetite for the stars of the meal.....the meats!As I said earlier I've been to Brazilian steakhouses many times I was anticipating the meat to be tender and well seasoned.  I have to admit that the cuts weren't what I was expecting (top and bottom sirloin, leg of lamb, chicken) I'm used to cuts like lamb chops, rib eye, etc so I was a little disappointed.  Also, none of the meat had the seasoning that I am accustomed to as well.  Most of what we ate was just ok - nothing special.  For sides we had an order of mashed potatoes and sweet plantain (not with the cinnamon sugar that I'm accustomed to).  For dessert I had the cheesecake, again, just ok.I do have to give a shout out to the service - although we never knew exactly who our actual waiter was because whichever waiter was in the area serviced us, I will say they were attentive and very pleasant.I'm wondering if the types of meat offered changes when it isn't restaurant week, although with the prices they charge I'm not so sure I want to risk coming back.",3.0,"Mar 17, 2022"

"While enjoying our meal, I was worried my girlfriend would notice the seductive look I gave the waiters when they brought over the lamb... And who could blame me! As always, Fogo was an amazing and memorable dining experience. A reservation is definitely a must. The service was impeccable and I never looked at an empty glass of water. The MVP of the meal was certainly the lamb (ask for a side  of mint jelly!!) and the bacon featured at the market table was TO DIE FOR. Make sure to pace yourself throughout at least 2 hours to fully enjoy (and digest) all that Fogo has to offer.Fogo De Chao is well worth the price and should be on almost every foodie's bucket list!",5.0,"Aug 14, 2019"
"Came here for a lunch buffet. No wait since we made a reservation but during weekday lunch, it's quite busy.Food:1. Sides:The complimentary sides are cheese bread (omg they are so delicious), mashed potatoes, caramelized banana and a fried cheese stick (not sure if it's cheese inside but it did taste like it)2. Buffet bar selection:There are all kinds of salad, fruits, vegetables, bacon, rice & toppings, and soup of the day. I'm very satisfied with the fruit selection: other than the basic fruits they also have dragon fruit as well as papaya.3. Meat There are many types of meat. The way it works is that you can flip the card to the green side, and the server with the meat will come and ask if you like it. The server also asked us what type of meat we were waiting for since we've been waiting for the lamb chops for a long time. And the server came directly to us once the chops were ready.Service:Great service in general. It's around $55/person include tax & tips. Advice: If you don't have a big appetite and still want to enjoy the buffet and eat many types of meat, I suggest getting different selections of the meat at once and then take a break (by flipping the card to the red side). Once you finish 1 round, it's likely that new selections of meat will be served.",4.0,"Oct 19, 2019"
"For NYC Restaurant Week, this is an incredible deal. You get unlimited meat/trips to the salad bar/side dishes (cheese bread, fried polenta, mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas). First off, I love the decor of this restaurant. It's multi-level, and super spacious. Dining takes place on the lower level, and you get to walk down a set of stairs into the center of the room (what an entrance). However, if you need an elevator, don't worry -- they have one! The salad bar/feijoada is incredible expansive (all types of fruit -- even dragon fruit, cheese, charcuterie, rice, soup, delicious brown sugar bacon, salmon, etc.).  Also, I love that they use little cardboard coasters to indicate whether you want meat or not. Once you flip it over to yes, they start coming pretty quickly! And I love that you can pick whether you want it rare, medium, well-done. The cheese bread and mashed potatoes were also delicious. At the end, each person was also able to select a dessert (NY cheesecake, key lime, or chocolate mousse). All in all, great value & fun dining experience.",5.0,"Aug 2, 2019"

"The service was very attentive, bringing around different cuts of meat. We could order specific meat dishes.There were also plenty of non-beef options from lamb, pork, chicken, bacon, salmon. There were also many vegetarian options from cheeses, fruit, salads, soup, etc.The only bad thing was that it took forever to get the check. I guess that's the downside to having 50 waiters that just float from table to table instead of being assigned to a specific table as per usual. It's definitely an interesting setup and operation rather than the traditional steak dinner where you order and enjoy one cut of meat--here you get to try several different cuts, meats and you can also order what isn't brought around (such as chicken hearts).The decor, atmosphere and orderliness were excellent.",4.0,"Oct 1, 2017"
"The main complaint here is that sometimes the meat comes out way too salty especially the lamb cuts. However, the Gauchos did accommodate our no salt requests. Ask for your meats to be cooked with no salt and season on your own. With the Coronavirus, you have your choice of dining in the front of the building or socially distanced indoor seating. The salad bar is closed and each table seems to be sprayed with disinfectant. Servers wear masks.Service is still amazing. Our water was continuously refilled and our server always checked in to see how we were doing. To make up for the salad bar being closed, each table gets a free charcuterie platter upon being seated. Gauchos also come around with salad bar items including salmon and asparagus.",5.0,"Oct 13, 2020"
"Review for lunch visit December 24, 2019.I went here after seeing the 11:00am performance of A Christmas Spectacular featuring the Radio City Rockettes. It was just a short walk from Radio City Music Hall to 53rd Street.  Earlier in the morning I made a reservation on their website for 1:00pm (confirmed by email).The storefront was great - as you can see by the picture it really makes an impact. We arrived at 12:45pm and they took us (my wife and I) immediately. We availed ourselves of the free coat check. The experience is downstairs (pictured from the top of the staircase). Looking down makes an immediate and grand impression! Loved it. We were seated against wall at a table for two. Everyone was friendly and greeted us with enthusiasm. Just like other Brazilian steakhouses, there is a general overseer, the servers and the gauchos (the people that bring the meat).They explained the coasters at the table (flipping to green means to bring more meat and flipping to red means stop). We were offered bottled water, sparkling or tap - stuck with tap water and a couple diet cokes. The server also advised that if we didn't want meat, there were different fish selections we could just ask for off the menu.We then proceeded to the buffet area. Wow! This was the most extensive selection I have ever seen at a Brazilian restaurant (pictured). There was a variety of cheeses, deli meats including prosciutto and Genoa. At least 4 kinds of cheeses including blue cheese and Parmesan. We noticed a huge board of smoked salmon and capers; there were pickled onions and cornichons on the side as accompaniments. Beautiful!For those inclined, there were roasted peppers, roasted garlic and roasted asparagus. A variety of salads and fruits like kiwi, pineapple and melon. Beside the buffet in chafing dishes (near the wall) was rice, sweet potato and some kind of what looked like Brazilian pork stew.We returned to our table and continued to dine. The gauchos came by with meats like: top sirloin, bottom sirloin, lamb, pork, pork sausage, chicken leg and garlic steak. I thought the selection was typical.  The taste was good overall. Just a note: when we returned to the table, the server brought little breads, mashed potatoes, fried bananas, polenta and mashed potatoes - without asking. We avoid carbs so we did not eat any of this. Might be considered wasteful, so if you know this in advance I would tell the server so they don't waste the food or their time.I used the men's bathroom before I left. One stall and one urinal. It was clean with two sinks. I'd definitely return. Keep up the good work!",4.0,"Dec 25, 2019"
"Oh my yum! I had no idea such deliciousness could exist in buffet style.When you step into Fogo, the high ceilings, beautiful wooden interiors and classy decor already tell you that you've chosen your dining experience correctly today. For ~$40 at lunch, the meats just keep coming - you're left struggling between eating more of one dish because it's so good or saving room to try them all. Some meats I preferred over others, but so many have passed through my plate that I can't clearly recall which was which.I would highly recommend getting the full experience option to, well, get the full experience at Fogo de Chão",4.0,"May 12, 2017"

"First time at a Brazilian steakhouse and the food did not disappoint! Definitely save your appetite for this place. The service on the other hand was not as good as expected. We had 7pm reservations and waited 20 min to be seated while walk ins who arrived after us (a party of 2) were being seated first. The host who sends you down to the stairs was also very rude not sure what her deal was that night. We had to repeatedly ask for beer refills from our server who ended up forgetting so we asked another server. The 2 ended up bickering in front of us which seemed unexpected given how fancy this place was.

"I've visited Fogo de Chao in multiple different states now, with this one being the original location that I visited.  The experiences and service are all pretty similar.  If you're not familiar by now, you're provided with a card (more of a coaster), with the color green on one side and red on the other.  If you want more meat servings, you place your card with the green side facing up.  If you're full/satisfied, you place the card with the red side facing up.The full meat selection and salad buffet are included in the price of your meal, at a range of $64.While the concept is newer, this specific Fogo de Chao has fallen off.  Unfortunately, they tend to prioritize the lesser quality meats and avoid bringing the more expensive ones to your table.Multiple requests for specific cuts went ignored for some time until the end, when we really couldn't eat any further.If you've never been to Fogo de Chao, I would recommend you go at least once for the experience.  But it has fallen off a bit.",5.0,"Feb 8, 2020"

"Came here for weekend brunch and had a 5 star experience! The place itself is huge, beautifully decorated with these orange ceiling lights. The tables are classic old school steakhouse, elegant white table clothes etc.  Room itself is dim, giving you enough privacy to pig out. We started with the cheese breads - I had these when I visited Brazil years ago and they were literally amazing. Soft and fought with chewy cheese on the inside. With weekend brunch you get access to the full churrasco experience, sides and market table for ~$50 per person, which I thought was a great deal compared to dinner ($80?). Not sure if the meats/market table options were different though. There are also entrees a la carte. I had the passion fruit mimosa, which was sweet and refreshing, and my bf got the Bloody Mary which was quite tasty as well. Highly recommend the black pepper candied bacon from the market table, literally insane, super crispy crunchy and delicious. The mashed potatoes were also pretty good, smooth and creamy. Other sides were good as well, good salad option. Only regret was the cake went away at 2pm which we didn't know about until after. Then began the churrasco experience. I thought they had a really smart system- they give you one red sign and one green sign, green signals the servers to bring you more meat and red means stop. We were unfortunately seated in this back corner, which felt mia, but we still got our serving of meats. The house special beef was melt in your mouth, my bf described it as ""beef bacon"". Get it medium rare, sooo tender and juicy. All the other cuts were pretty good as well, although the garlic steak was a little overwhelming. Chicken and pork were good but I would probably stick with beef. I didn't see any lamb and when I mentioned it to our server, she was nice enough to have it brought over.

"In addition to the meat, they have a very nice buffet style salad/charcuterie bar with a large and tasty variety of things to choose from. They offer a couple tasty and well priced Happy Hours drinks as well. My disappointment is with the meat in that most of it was over cooked for my taste, although I suspect that's because the average person coming here likes their meat cooked more heavily than I do. Still we had a nice time and found plenty of tasty things to enjoy here.",4.0,"May 9, 2022"
"To be honest, I'm not sure what happened.Went for my birthday dinner as I used to (whether it is here or king of Prussia), and I hate to say it, but the experience was kind of lacking. Made a reservation, and got terrible seating in between people. What's annoying about being in between people? You will be skipped. Despite the two of us having our cards face up we were skipped, and by the time we were remembered, it was the very last pieces of whatever was left (which means no temperature preference) and they just.. weren't that good. The char was there, the salt was there, but it seemed like we kept getting these super fatty pieces and they just were not very good at all. It's hard to say for one of my favorite spots, I even kept telling my wife she was exaggerating, ""it's the same"", but honestly it was a bit off. That, the rice was under-cooked, the beans were flavorless, and where was the bacon? For the first time, the market bar was my friend because it made up for the lack of flavor in most of the meats.Somewhere towards the end we were asked if there was something we were looking for, because the same pieces kept coming and it was the end. We asked for Picanha when it comes out. We did get the picanha, and this was still my favorite, but by the time I finally got a piece of rib eye, it was so bad I had to say we were done. The pork ribs, and the last bottom sirloin I got, which again was the last of what was available, wasn't edible.At the end of the night, we did get a dessert, and the creme brulee was done masterfully. The top was light, crisp, perfect.Again, I honestly don't know what happened, I don't know why anything changed, but it's looking like I will have to try another spot to get my cultural fix.",3.0,"Sep 10, 2019"
"There is no way to give this less than 5 stars, NO WAY.From the moment we walked in the hostess is courteous , patient, and got us to our seats right away.Despite having an idea of how it works, our main waiter informed us on every aspect of how this experience. We were encouraged to start with the market bar, but not to fill up at all, because they will keep the meat coming. The bar was fit with olives, delicious mozzarella, cesar sald, bread, peppers, potato salad, salami, proscuitto, and so much more! The one item that sounded better than it was was the candied bacon, don't worry about that as there's plenty pork to go around. There is also rice and beans at the market table as well. We started with salad, peppers, salami, etc, as they would compliment the meats chosen.We tried every single one. Or at least I did, my woman got filled up and I had to encourage her to fight the good fight. Every piece, succulent, juicy, so much flavor especially in the parmesan pork and garlic steak. I could give you a long description of how amazing each individual cut was, but I'll get right into the ones that were so good I had to have more than one: parmesan pork, house sirloin, and the strip was the very best medium rare.I want to add this note, I have NEVER eaten medium rare before, and trying it opened up a whole new world for me. If you are used to well done, medium, etc, I strongly encourage you to try a slice of medium rare, you won't regret it, I promise.The only pieces I had any issue with is the lamb was a little tough, and I was given well.done filet that wasn't right. Honestly it was barely a bother considering they typically ask which temp you'd like first.This was a real experience for us both and while we do look forward to returning, we are excited to try the one in Puerto Rico on our next trip.Thank you for this experience, wow.",5.0,"Mar 6, 2016"
"Made reservations here for anniversary and it was an overall good experience. There were a bunch of ayce appetizers including the cheese bread which is my favorite but try to eat them in moderation because it can fill you up fast.

I don't remember the name of our waiter but he provided us great service.

"I'm in love with this place! All-you-can-eat steakhouse? Sign me up! Just thinking about the waiters slicing off tender, succulent pieces of beef onto the plate makes my mouth water. They have so many different cuts, from top sirloin to filet mignon to filet wrapped in bacon. There's also a couple types of lamb. Wouldn't recommend getting any of the chicken or pork (even if they are delicious), because you're there to eat beef!! You can ask for some accompanying sauce as well. Both the green (chimichurri) and red sauce are amazing. It's always a shame when you first sit down and they bring the warm, cheesy bread because it's so tempting but you don't want to eat too many pieces and get full on that. 1 or 2 at most. The garlic mashed potatoes side is also irresistible. Then head over to the market table, which has a nice diversity of items for accompaniment. Roasted vegetables, chickpeas, cheese, fruit to eat after the main course.Dinner price is $66.95 per person which is on the pricier side. I've never been there for the $42.95 lunch before but would definitely try to go at some point",5.0,"Mar 9, 2019"

"I got invited with my yelp friends for restaurant week dinner in this place. The whole amount we paid was $60 + including tip & a 1 pitcher of sangria shared for 4 people. Great deal! We had a reservation for 8:30pm & got seated on time. The restaurant is really big & clean. The waiters are nice & friendly. I'm impressed with their salad bar. Lots of delicious choices. They have sweet crispy bacon for your salad, cheese, fruits & a lot more. If you're not careful you'll be full just by their salad bar alone but better watch out because lots of yummy meat coming. For the pitcher of sangria, I don't really drink & don't enjoy the strong alcohol taste but this sangria is fruity & sweet so I like it. Good pair for churrascaria (bbq). On the table they gave cheese bread & fried banana. It taste good. They also used a circle flip go signal if you want more meat then you turn it into green & red for stop giving me meat. Haha! From the sirloin, bacon wrap chicken, bacon wrap steak, marinated chicken & many more its all delicious. All cooked perfectly base on your preference. They also ask what type of meat do you want, medium or medium well but I myself like medium.If you're a meat lover then this is the place for you. I highly recommend going here with an empty stomach.

I'm a small person and I know that sometimes people don't take me seriously for that reason but he kept ignoring me! Even when I straight up asked him for something!! So RUDE!! Never have I ever.

"The word ""churrascaria"" really rolls off the tongue. Unfortunately, so does some of the meats served during restaurant week. It's roughly $15 cheaper than regular fare, minus the higher quality meat cuts. Hardly worth it, except for the complimentary dessert and the fact that I can say I've finally eaten at a Brazilian steakhouse.Despite my better instincts, I sampled the chicken and pork, both of which were husks of rather bland meats. Lamb was well marinated, although it didn't have that charred taste I look for in most lamb dishes. I believe the only steak cut I enjoyed was the sirloin. It sported a fair amount of gristle and lathered in garlic butter. Ugh, that was good. All the other cow parts seem lacking in moisture or heavily covered in salt. Not entirely a bad thing... just had higher expectations. There weren't any distinct flavors, so it's hard to give any reason why this steakhouse stands out. I didn't even touch the drink menu. For $18 a glass, I'd rather be caught passed out in an alleyway with a bottle.The dessert is obligatory if you want to make the Restaurant Deal worth it because I'd rather pay the $15 more to have an unlimited amount of the higher cuts. Their options were chocolate mousse, keylime, and cheesecake. It's all very standard.",4.0,"Jul 26, 2020"

"I've never dined at an ""Authentic Brazilian Barbecue"" venue before so this place was a sure eye-opener. We made a reservation for a party of 3 for a Thursday evening. We were quickly seated and our waiter explained how the ordering process works. The meat was never ending, and you had your choice of different kinds and cuts of meat. They ranged from lamb chops to fillet mignons and smoked sausages. The meats were literally cut right in front of you to the doneness  of your choice. I had a majority of my steaks medium rare- medium. Just the way I like it. There was also an open salad bar that consisted of cooked rice, different cheeses and deli meats...which I later took advantage of. The starters here weren't bad either. Definitely try the garlic mashed potatoes, polenta and cheese bread. We settled for dessert at the end of our meal. Dessert was a great way to end a big meal. My only complaint was that the slices of cake were paper thin.",5.0,"Oct 15, 2022"
"Went there with some friends for RW; I'm currently pescetarian, so I didn't participate, but they seemed to enjoy the food. The service was ""okay"" at best; they messed up my drink order twice and still charged me. They also sat us in a very cramped corner, and refused to move us. I also waited a really long time for my seafood dish.I ordered the mango sea bass; sea bass is great because of how buttery it is, but the mango sauce was kind of overpowering. Not really the best taste combination.I probably wouldn't go again. Ever.",3.0,"Feb 4, 2019"
"- overall rating: 3.5- no wait with reservation - came with a large (20+) group, staff was a little slow with the drinks but for the size of the group, they managed themselves well- there was a bit of a dispute with the bill (a few paid early had to catch a flight and the staff argued with us about whether they paid their portion of the bill, but ultimately was resolved)- wish they had seasoned their meat a bit more, was mostly bland, and some pieces were chewier than I had anticipated- I find the food at Churrascaria Plataforma better, but Fogo has a more modern feel",4.0,"Dec 6, 2018"

We choose the non dessert option because usually will get full before hitting the desserts. Great value. This place is very spacious, high ceiling and a lot of tables. We got seated very fast and soon after they are already coming to serve the meat. For the restaurant week/month they don't offer the 4 prime cut but there were still a lot of meat options.

"This was my second time here. The first time was AMAZINGGGG!!! We were in the main dining area and everything was great. Decided to go for my husband's birthday recently. We were a group of 15. The food was still good but we were seated in a back table of their ""private room"" which actually resembled a cafeteria or waiting area. I wish we were in the main dining area to get the full experience. Also, the check took forever to the point where I had to go look for a manager. She was very nice and we were offered a free round of wine. Although it was a nice gesture we had plans to go somewhere else for an hour. The check took nearly an hour to be brought out so we could not make it to the second place since a few of us had made babysitting arrangements and had to get back to our babies. If I return again I'll ask to be seated in the main area for more attention. It kinda ruined the end of the night since things didn't go as planned.",3.0,"Feb 28, 2019"

"I came here for their restaurant week dinner deal which is $42 (excluding tax and tips) for unlimited meats and salad bar. The difference between this deal and the regular full churrasco experience is that for the restaurant week deal, you can't get the beef ribs, ribeye, filet mignon and lamb chops. For this deal, you also get some sides (cheese bread, crispy polenta, mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas) throughout the meal. At the end, you get to choose a dessert, either cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake or key lime pie. The lamb and top sirloins were my favorites because they were so tender. The other options tasted average to me. All the side dishes were delicious, especially that cheese bread (looks like a cream puff)! With unlimited side dishes, soups, and meats, you'll get full pretty fast. It was a bit overwhelming for me. I would recommend that you come try this place for restaurant week first  because the price is so much cheaper compare to the regular price of $67.

The hard truth: restaurant staff was excellent and super helpful made the experience worth it. The highlights of this adventure was the the bacon from the buffet the bacon made me say wow the potato salad was good. The Meats the servers was bringing out was ok the house meat was exceptional a+ the perfect amount of salt the other skewers was a it on the salty so if you have high blood pressure this is not the place for you. The Tomahawk steak was 32 Oz steak but it was not a 32 Oz steak it was like a 18-20oz at most steak was how I wanted it medium rare not salty nice and soft the chimicuri sauce was great... the bottom line it is a good experience and I recommend you try it gave 4 stars because of the the Tomahawk steak size it it was actually a bigger size like stated on the menu.

They do have taken measures like checking temperatures, asking us to put down our contact information incase they need to track the spread and have hand sanitizers.

Tasty and in some of the meats you can choose if medium-rare or medium when they come to your table.You have to pay extra for dessert, but they are all quite good!

"very disappointed.  I went to the new Paramus location for happy hour today. When I arrived at around 6 PM, I was one of four people at the bar. There were at least four bartenders. they were standing around talking to each other, and it took about five minutes for one of them to greet me despite the fact that they kept passing me, and I kept trying to get their attention. Lavender was by far the friendliest bartender, and she makes a mean drink! If I could have her take care of me, every time I went, and I would definitely return! She was the highlight of my evening, because the other bartenders completely ignored me. I ordered some food and it took quite a while for it to get to me even though the restaurant was fairly empty. I went to the ladies room. Again it was not late, perhaps 7 PM. One sink faucet did not work. another soap was empty. There was no paper towels, and the toilet paper needed to be replaced. I had to tell the manager. Where are the people that are supposed to be monitoring these things?  eventually, I wanted to leave and it took me several minutes to get the bartender's attention. Lavender was on the other side of the bar so I cannot fault her. The bartender finally brought me my check and I immediately put my credit card down, and again had to wait for her attention, and she completely ignored me.  There is the difference between giving people time to enjoy themselves and completely ignoring them. I'm very disappointed in the service.",3.0,"Mar 17, 2023"

"Fogo was great. All the meats were delicious - the picanha was incredible.Stepping inside, I was shocked by the churrascaria's size. It's one of the biggest restaurants I've ever been to - tons of people. Yet, the ambiance is very nice, it does not feel crowded, and there are plenty of servers who take care of you. The buffet was decent. Pretty basic foods. I liked their assortment of cheeses. Plus, the nonstop banana appetizers were great, and the butter bread . The real worth, however, is in the meat. The bottom and top sirloins were amazing, and the picanha was sliced so think it melted in our mouths. The bottom sirloin was well done, the top, very much rare. Everything else was simply alright, so we kept waited for those 3 cuts.The dessert and cocktails were good, but nothing special.",5.0,"Aug 16, 2022"
"All the meats you could possibly want. You don't get the full experience until you do the meat carving option ($40 for lunch, $65 for dinner) where the waiters bring on endless options for you to choose from. There will definitely be more meat on your plate than you can eat. I'd recommend trying small pieces of each one until you find the ones you like. Also order the Guarana soda. Just do it.",5.0,"Jan 28, 2022"

"Fogo de Chao was truthfully amazing . I came to celebrate father's day with my family . We all got the Full Churrasco Experience . First of all I'd like to mention that the waiters bring out the different variety of meats so often , we LOVEED it . My favorite was the chicken and the beef ribeye. All the meats seasoned so well. One of my biggest fears was not being served meats frequently. The salad bar had such an amazing array of options from fruits , vegetables, salads . The white rice and beans were soooo good omg , and the warm pão de queijo ( cheese bread ) was SOO GOOD . All in all I have zero complaints. Father's day caused the restaurant to have so many reservations yet we still received optimal treatment . All the drinks we ordered was amazing as well .  I cannot complain about anything . My family and I enjoyed my father on father's day thanks to this restaurant !",5.0,"Jun 25, 2021"
Best Brazilian Experience!Todos visitantes brasileiros precisam conhecer e ter essa experiencia!!,5.0,"Jan 19, 2022"
"My husband and I had dinner here a week after having tried the other popular Brazilian steakhouse in the area, Churrascaria Plataforma. While both have their upsides and downsides, I enjoyed Fogo de Chao more overall.Meat selection seemed to be better, and the salad bar was by far better with a selection of cheeses and fresh fruit. My favorite cuts were the ribeye, filet mignon (bacon wrapped and normal), and the top sirloin. Instead of the usual fried bananas, they caramelize their bananas here too, and they are delicious! The PDQ bread here is more airy than what you would usually get, but when at Brazilian restaurant you shouldn't be filling up on bread or sides anyway. The PDQ, by the way, is gluten free - my husband has celiacs sprue and had no issues.Our waiter was very friendly, and even asked if there were select cuts we were waiting for. The dining area is very spacious, beautiful, and modern. Definitely a great place for a date night.",4.0,"Apr 21, 2018"
"Went there with a group of friends.  We had a reservation,  We arrived and we were seated very quick.  The first waiter came over was very nice and friendly, but then he disappear.  Another waiter came along and asked us what we want to drinks.  We asked for a wine menu, he was happy to bring us the menu, and he recommend us some EXPENSIVE wine, which we didn't order.  We ordered the one we wanted, and he wasn't happy about it.  He said we need at least two bottles of it, we told him we will start off one bottle first.  Again, his attitude start to change.  Service wasn't great at all..  As for the meat selection, there's wasn't much selection at all, most of the came repeating itself.  Finally we ask them if they have Ribs and beef ribs, then they one of the guys said he will ring it out.  When he bought it couple, it was only a couple of pork ribs.  Then I asked again for beef ribs, he finally bough it out with a small proton it it, and it was way over cooked and very dried.  This place used to be really good..  Now the food selection and the service is not as good as it used to be.  To me, it doesn't worth over $70 per person for all you can eat meat since it's not much selection of the meat.",1.0,"Aug 14, 2021"

"I do not want to give this place a low rating but I had a really terrible time here. It was expensive and the service was very slow. The meats came out very slowly and they were mostly repeats. It also took over 15 minutes to get the check and the check was sitting on the other table the entire time but the female waitress did not bother giving it to our table. We had to ask twice to get the check. I had the chicken wrapped with bacon, filet mignon, lamb, and sausage. They tasted okay. The salad bar was very limited compare to the other Brazilian Steakhouses I went to. The rice that they had was very hard too. I do not know why this place has such high ratings. I had the tomatoes, rice and beans, peppers, and fresh mozzarella. It was just so limited. Half way through the meal, the wait staff finally gave us the sides, manduras and polenta. The only highlights were the drinks and cheese bread. I also had drinks-Guava Do Sul- it has Belvedere Vodka, guava, lemon, La Marca Prosecco and the one with the cucumber in it was really good.I do not recommend this place as the service was slow and there are too many repeat meats -not enough variety. The food was very mediocre especially given the price. Afterwards I got really sick and my stomach was hurting. I have a very strong stomach and this almost never happens.",2.0,"Jun 22, 2021"
My family and I went here for Fathers Day and were very disappointed. We had to wait an hour for our 6:45 reservation because they overbooked. When I mentioned this to the host he blamed the wait on me for not accepting to dine outside. Dining outside means we would have had to go up and down the stairs every time we went to the Feijoada Bar. So naturally we had no choice but to wait. When we finally got seated the dining room was in complete chaos. We were offered a free round of drinks which I thought was a nice gesture. But then the bad service started. We decided to go with the Churrasco Experience but due to the overbooking we only experienced 5 meats. We literally had to flag the men down so we could get a slice of beef. When a restaurant sacrifices service just to get a few more bodies in the place it's time to move on. Note to management - Giving such bad service on a special day leaves a lasting impression.,5.0,"Oct 25, 2021"

"Prepare to spend some dollars in Fogo de Chao!! Bring your stimulus money for the check if it's more than two people. The one thing I didn't like about this place is the prices for things are not listed. They have a variety of different meats that they serve table side, which are very good and juice. The salad bar options were varied and accommodated vegetarian and vegan customers but wouldn't be worth the price if you are vegetarian or vegan. Still enoyiably though",3.0,"Jun 1, 2018"
"My first experience at a Brazilian all you can eat steakhouse and I would say it was just average.Most of the meats were salty and though the chicken was very tender & juicy it was flavorless. If I had to choose my favorite it would be the top sirloin & bacon wrapped steak. Both had a good amount of fat/juice but still salty towards the end. I really wanted to enjoy the filet mignon but it had a weird texture :( I think I drank so much water that I was more bloated from that than the actual food. Definitely pricey and not worth the $64. However, service was attentive and it wasn't too packed on a Thursday night.",4.0,"Aug 18, 2018"

"If you love meat and you've never experienced churrascaria/rodizio, do yourself a favor and go try one. All-you-can-eat meat brought right to your table? Yes please. I've been to a couple other churrascarias before but this was my first time at Fogo. I went with a group of friends for Restaurant Week and despite a more limited dinner menu,  I thought just about everything was great. I won't go through every type of meat I tried, but I tried them all and the majority were delicious and cooked to perfection. My favorite was probably the picanha or fraldinha, both cuts of sirloin. They both had a good lean:fat ratio for great juicyness and flavor. The lombo, or parmesan pork, was probably my least favorite. It wasn't terrible but I found it a little too salty. The meats are the star of the show of course but the sides are no slouch either. Hands down my favorite is the pao de quiejo (cheese bread). The mashed potatoes were very good as well, but I didn't eat much to save room for the meat. I found myself taking a little bite of sweet plantains when my mouth was overwhelmed by the different meats. Best part? All the sides or all-you-can-eat as well. The ""market table"" (read salad bar) is exceptional as well. They have all sorts of vegetables, cured meats, and cheeses for you to enjoy. I was torn when I saw all the delicious options because even a big guy such as myself can only eat so much. Dessert was on point as well. Between my friends and I, I got to try 3 kinds:  key lime pie, chocolate mousse, and cheesecake. Of the 3 the cheesecake was my favorite but all were solid ways to finish off a superb meal. If I had to complain about something I'd say the bathroom could be a bit larger considering how large the restaurant is. I'm not sure how many others there were, but the one I went into had one urinal and one stall leaving a queue of people outside waiting. It was very clean though.All in all Fogo de Chao is a wonderful experience.",4.0,"Jun 13, 2021"

All kinds of salad, cheese, fruits etc. Dessert menu for restaurant week only has 2 options cheese cake and chocolate cake. Only reason why im giving a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the waiting time. I made a reservation at 730pm and arrived at 7:20. We werent seated until 7:50.

Second I am sorry I didn't take more pictures of the food but as soon as it hit my plate I couldn't resist lol. There is a buffet of cold food (salads, cheeses, veggies, etc) and they bring sides to your table (bread [divine], mashed potatoes, maduros etc) and they have a non stop surplus of all the meat you can eat still sizzling as they come serve it to you. Omg so good! Steaks and chickens and lambs and ribs and bacon wrapped things being bought straight to you from the kitchen by their amazing staff.

When going to the salad bar the waiters will serve you what you want to put on your plate probably to reduce contact between so many people and open food.

"Wow... as a long time Fogo lover this was EMBARRASSING! I have personally been to multiple Fogo's around the country but this is by far the worst. To begin:  1. the amount of people they cramp into that basement of a restaurant I can assure you is a fire hazard. you can't walk anywhere without running into a another table and overall that many people close together is truly unappetizing. 2. the food...abysmal. Literally uneditable. if i am paying $75 dollars for meat...that meat should at least have some kind of flavor or skill put into cooking it. I could probably cook meat of that quality in my dorm room with a waffle maker. All the meat was dry and over cooked and the meat quality was just above a halal cart in times square. Also the buffet was so repulsive, the food was not well displayed and was extremely unappetizing. 3. The amount of selling on top of the $75 I was already paying was soooo tacky. If i wanted to pay more then I will look for those opportunities myself, don't send people to my table to sell me things. Literally salesman vibes that made me embarrassed that it was even happening. And the cost of these extras don't even equal the quality or quantity of the food. We paid $27 for 5 mini shrimp that looked like they were frozen and not remotely fresh.4. There were about 50 tables and 1 womens bathroom with two stalls... one of which was not working. I don't even need to elaborate on that. I had high hopes for this restaurant given its location in the city but man was it horrible. I will be contacting the corporate office about my experience because this is by far the worst Fogo de Chao I have ever been to and frankly the franchise should be embarrassed.",2.0,"Aug 22, 2019"

It was my first time eating in this unlimited eat all you can serving restaurant, it was extremely fun and exciting. My friend makes me feel so happy when we go to new places because she knows more than me about all these places and she kindly enough tells me how things work (I love her !)...lolSo we sat and a circular color thing magingy is placed on the table, Red means stop feeding me, and turn it around the Green means feed me.  lolThe servers come to the tables with delicious meats on a stick and I was given meat to eat, about 5 or 6 different meats, over and over until I can't eat no more....lolol  that was really, really fun.  Is like speed dating but with meats, although I had only seen scenes of speed dating on TV, never done it, but that is what it looks like, speed eating with meats :) amazing !You know when they say New York have everything, this restaurant makes it so, this is an absolute restaurant that is a must do in NYC. It is pricey but sooo much worthy, one must do this at least once in a lifetime.The coffee gets 1 star, it has nothing special about it, and the coffee cup was too small, one of those tiny coffee cups and the coffee flavor was nothing but average.

"I was here for restaurant week and I was actually really excited. I LOVEEEE steak so seeing there was a deal for this place on restaurant week, my friends and I jumped on the opportunity. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Walking down the stairs to the dining area, I was blown away. We were seated quickly and within a few minutes, the meat was being brought out. The first one I got, I think it was the Picanha (?) was the absolute best one of the night. It was cooked to perfection, juicy, and so tender. However, after that, the quality of the meats somehow went downhill. They started to become extremely chewy, some way overcooked, and when we asked for a certain cut, we were told they were being sent our way but we waited way too long for it. Some people just completely ignored us too. The thin cut top sirloin was delicious as well, but again, he only came around once so I wasn't able to get another piece. I really wanted to like this place but I honestly can't justify the regular price. Even with restaurant week, it was about $60-70 per person with tip. Maybe it was because we ate later on in the night and the quality of the meats weren't the best, but I was disappointed to say the least. I would come back here and give it another shot eventually.",3.0,"Mar 5, 2018"

"This is the famous national chain of AYCE (All You Can Eat for the uninitiated) Brazilian steakhouses. Basically, it entails a bunch of dudes circling ""the space"" and cutting off amazing cuts of meat from a metal stick (bacon-wrapped chicken, sausages, top sirloin, filet mignon, you name it). You can have as much as you want. Is this 'really' how it's done in Brazil? I don't have a clue, but Ioved it. I entertained the place having only eaten a bagel all day, and I was salivating and ate so much food. Research shows your body can take in a ton of food for like 20 minutes before it starts to shut down, so start scarfing right away after your first bite. We had to stop after 45 minutes and barely being able to walk to the salad bar, which is frankly a complete waste of time. Are you really here for salami, lettuce, and cheese?! ""The space"" is really nicely, some might say extravagantly, decorated. You climb and down a big flight of stairs to get to the tables, and boy, after all you eat, YOU WILL NEED IT.",5.0,"Jan 28, 2016"
"Came here for restaurant week with a group of 4. Make sure you make reservations because the wait can be up to 2 hours for walk ins. The interior had an upscale feel to it. There were 3 floors. Top was the bar, second was bar and waiting area and the bottom was the dining area. Once we were seated, our waiter explained how the system works and told us we can get started at the salad bar right away. There were many options at the salad bar. Ranges from fruits, veggies, soup, cheeses, salads and various types of meats. I didn't want to get full off the salad bar and only had bits and pieces of some stuff. The apple fruit salad was delicious and refreshing. The brussel salad can be skipped. It was lacking in flavor and tasted like it had been out for too long. Along with our meal came the caramelized bananas, cheese bread, polenta and garlic mashed potatoes. The cheese bread was definitely a favorite of the table and tasted even better when it was hot. The waiters also kept refilling it throughout our meal!Now onto the good stuff: the meat. I think it's all based on luck with the cut of meat you get. I was not a fan of the parmesan coated pork loin. It was very salty and dry. But then my friends had a very juicy piece so it's really all luck based on which piece you get. The bacon wrapped chicken was very moist. Ribs were really good but a little on the salty side. The beef was amazing. This place is definitely a meat lovers galore. The house signature had to be my favorite! Next would be the prime part of the top sirloin. For restaurant week, you only get 3 choices for dessert. You can pick from the cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake and key lime pie. They were average. Nothing over the top. Could be because we were so stuffed from our meal. Overall I had a great experience and would probably come back if they participate in restaurant week during the Summer. The waiters were so polite and they do not rush you at all. You can take your time eating and when you're ready to go, you just have to let them know. They were very professional and friendly for a place that gets very busy.

The guys who were going around with the diff meats barely came around and we asked them if they can come back around and they never came as well.

She made sure to send people to the bar while we waited for everyone to show up. When it was time to be seated she came and showed us to our table. She was nothing short of pleasant and professional!When we sat down we were greeted by our waiters Alex and William who guided us through the menu and were able to answer any questions we had. They were very attentive and kind, especially to one of our guests who just celebrated his 92nd birthday. We were treated like family.After going to the salad bar, we were treated to an onslaught of food! All of the meat was delicious but my favorite was the Bottom Round Sirloin. So much flavor!It was our first time having a fine dining experience at Fogo de Chao, but it will certainly not be the last. Everyone who had dinner tonight agreed that we'll be back regularly and with even more people. I hope the corporate bosses at Fogo de Chao see this review so they can see what exceptional employees they have!",5.0,"Sep 9, 2021"

"This is hands down the best Brazilian Steakhouse in NYC!!! The quality of meats from the top sirloin, ribeye, filet mignon. the lamb ugh just melts in your mouth!!! The salad bar was phenomenal!! Super fresh. FEIJOADA!!!! CAIPIRINHAS!!! Great for a group or even an imitate dinner for two!Sheer Brazilian Delight!! Must go!!!!!",2.0,"May 19, 2022"

"I usually opt for salad bar only (no way I can eat $60 worth of meat). But for $38, I think I had a chance! This fogo de chao location opened soon after I moved to DC, I was excited to return in time for summer restaurant week! Compared to DC's, the salad bar selection was actually smaller. But I would say it was better prepared - the squashes were nicely charred, the watermelon feta actually dressed in balsamic vinegar, even the green steak sauce was less runny. Meat - Although most diners came for their top sirloins, after trying a bit of everything, I knew where my money/belly was going - chicken drumsticks and pork ribs. The chicken drumsticks were tender and juicy (fell right off the bone!), the pork ribs were perfectly fatty and beautifully seasoned! My dining companion made a comment that I must had eaten two arm length worth of chicken drumstick alone... Plus the pork ribs - meat sweat? the struggle was real. I knew I couldn't refuse the cheesy bread - much bigger than ones in DC, somehow I managed to eat 6 and still asked for refills. Then it dawned me that I still had dessert to come! Key lime pie - half of their normal portion - loved the graham cracker crust but found the pie as a whole overwhelmingly sweet. I would recommend sticking to their chocolate mousse cake instead. Service was attentive and meats were plenty. Although I don't see myself returning for full price dinner - but for restaurant week, definitely worth a visit!",4.0,"Aug 15, 2015"
"This is one of the best places to come for restaurant week. No, you do not get smaller portions (like some restaurants do), you will be so stuffed to your heart's content.The only difference in the regular menu vs restaurant week menu is that you don't get certain cuts of meats. But for the restaurant week menu, you were able to eat a good amount of meats. I enjoyed different cuts of sirloin, the lamb etc. The pork wrapped in Parmesan cheese was a little tough. You also get access to the cold buffet, which is great. They had prosciutto, smoked salmon, rice and beans, hearts of palm. They also gave us a basket of the most amazing bread, it had cheese in it! It resembled mochi. We were also given 3 sides- mashed potato, polenta and plantains. I am definitely coming back for restaurant week!",4.0,"Aug 5, 2015"
"So I've been to fogo de chao in Santana row in San Fran, that was the first and only fogo I've been to. I've been to several Brazilian steak houses though, but fogo is kind of in its own class. Came here for restaurant week which was $42 for dinner which included about 7 meats, sirloins, pork ribs, chicken, sausage and bacon wrapped steak. The salad bar however was included as well, the salad bar has several different options, cured meats, bacon (some of the best I've had), rice and beans, veggies, several cheeses and plenty more. The decor and set up of fogo is absolutely brilliant. It is an amazing sight to see, the decor is just stunning. We had reservations for 4 around 9 pm and we were seated about 905 pm. The meat and salad bar were absolutely delicious. Everything was superb here, the only thing keeping this from a 5 for me is the fact that we had to ask for the sauce for our meats about 4-5 times before it finally came out & they brought over the same meats for about the first 5 trips so we had to tell them to switch it up. Now I understand they were super busy so that could have been the reason they were a bit confused or delayed but nonetheless still an amazing place. Make sure you ask for an extra order of their complimentary cheese bread as well!! You will not be disappointed.",4.0,"Aug 6, 2019"
Don't have much to say aside great service! Food is so mediocre. The only meat that was good was the filet mignon. The rest was bland or over salted. The side dishes were a poor excuse. The bar had absolutely nothing interesting. Some Mexican and American staples that were not even tasty. Won't return. For $80/person. Avoid. A Chinese Buffet is better and that's a sad comparison.,1.0,"Jun 7, 2022"

Love going to Fogo  I'm seriously in love with there market table. I could eat it all day everyday. From the artichoke to the palm hearts. Fogo is someplace I go when I'm in the mood to eat like a pig lol but I still hold back lol. Love the ambiance the service and the selections.  The sea bass was a little bland to me but I like things well seasoned with some heat. What can I say some like it hot.,3.0,"Mar 6, 2021"
"Beautiful place, good vibe, friendly staff.. but not what we thought it was going to be. After everyone passes once or twice they stop passing by and is not the unlimited experience they advertise. I had to request with the waiter for a cut of meat to make an appearance at the table after everyone passed by us several times for over 30 min. It seems as they are directed on who to go to and once your time is up they stop going to you",3.0,"Jan 25, 2020"
"This place was so good, I just had to come here again in less than a week for restaurant week!!For restaurant week only:If you wanna wine and dine, but can't afford a fancy dinner, this place is worth your time and your money. However, you better act fast because the reservations get booked quickly, especially if you have a large party.The first time around, I came with 4 people and we didn't have a reservations because it was booked solid. They told us to come and wait, so we did and they told us 3 hours.... But don't get discouraged, we only waited 1 hour and could have been seated earlier if our whole party was here on time. So key note: EVERYONE MUST BE HERE ON TIME, or you will NOT get seated!You must come on an empty stomach and ready to eat your hard out. How it works:Step 1) You get your appetizers like you would at a buffet Step 2) The waiter should have given you coasters with a red and green side. (Incase you don't know, green = keep the meat coming!, red = so full and can't fit any more in my stomach)Step 3) flip that coaster to GREEN and the meat will start coming! You will have a wise range of meat selections.. Sirloin, chicken wrapped, pork...Step 4) EAT your heart out and have seconds, thirds and fourthsStep 5) once you are full, turn that coast to REDStep 6) Always make room for dessertStep 7) FOOD COMA!!!Quality of food:Excellent! They bring the meat to you and you can select the cut you want. I suggest medium rare and if you can, get some of the outer parts of the meat where it is seasoned.Dessert: I absolutely loved the key lime pie!!Sides: the plantains are to die for!!!Overall: great service, great impression....if I wasn't a broke recent grad, I would come here every week.",5.0,"Aug 12, 2015"
"Fantastic customer service ---- I came here on Friday, June 18th when unfortunately they had an outage in the kitchen. June, Francey, & Dante went out of their way to accommodate my table (by offering free appetizers) even offering free drinks towards the end.

"One of the better churasscarias in the city. If you don't already know, you get all you can eat Brazilian meats and a buffet bar for one price plus drinks. The meats were salted nicely and enjoyed almost everything they brought out from top sirloin, filets, flank steak and beef ribs. The place is a bit on the dark side and is located in a huge sunken basement area but nicely appointed. Service is a bit frantic but attentive and there are tons of staff always around the tables so you are never left looking for a waiter. The weekend brunch is a great deal and kids under 7 eat free so that is a huge plus if you're stopping in midday. However, the dinner seems to have a larger selection of meats and better service.  Personally I would go there for dinner rather than brunch. The buffet/salad bar is a little lazy here though. For example, they don't even take the seeds off the melon or skin off the kiwis. I do prefer the buffets at the other churascarias in the city. But since the focus is on all the wonderful meats, I don't seem to dwell on that much here.  If you're a meat lover, go and you will not be too disappointed at all.",4.0,"Mar 10, 2018"

Prep yourself by going with an empty stomach :D I have been wanting to come here since I was a freshman in college....thankfully my friend had an extra spot during NYC restaurant week recently and invited me. SOOOO lucky! It's cheaper during restaurant week (you get fewer meat options....did not impact us at all since there was already sooooooooo much food and diverse options)The market section of cured meats, smoked salmon, charcuterie, rice and beans, salads, and more was INCREDIBLE. Loved the sides of crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, caramelized banana, and cheesy bread.The servers come around to your table when you have the green card visible.

"3.5 starsCame here with friends for restaurant week! Even though we arrived a little after our reservation and one person short, the hostess still had no problem getting us seated. I don't know why people make it seem like getting a reservation here is harder than finding the meaning of life...We literally just made the reservation a few days before. No need to reserve a month in advance. There is a clear distinction in where you are seated depending on whether or not you choose the RW option. We got seated in an isolated area in the back corner, away from everyone else but whatever, more privacy. After you are seated, you start by going up to the salad bar for cold options. They have some expensive items like prosciutto and fancy cheeses but everything else is pretty common (ex. potato salad, roasted peppers, bread, etc.). After you return to your table you can flip the little card that they give you to the green side and the workers will start coming over with the meats. I was worried that they were only going to bring over the expensive cuts once, as some reviews say they do, and only keep coming with the less expensive stuff like chicken, but they actually do bring over the good stuff like steak a couple of times.Excellent:- All 3 cuts of sirloinMeh:- Lamb (only because it was a bit undercooked)- Pork ribs (too dry)- Bacon wrapped chicken (too dry)- Pork sausage (too salty)In addition to the meats, the waiters also bring over pao de queijo, polenta, mashed potatoes, and bananas, all of which were good apps. Dessert was a sweet way to end the meal. Get the chocolate mousse cake! So good!Overall, I would consider this a good RW experience. Service was excellent and not snooty at all. Our waiter was literally the best. It's a fancy restaurant but the dress attire is casual. There were some diners dressed in suits but also a good amount of people wearing t-shirts and jeans (us included lol) so you definitely won't feel underdressed. As a summary of the food, you really have to be a meat lover in order to enjoy this place. I thought I liked eating meat but it honestly got a bit too much about halfway through to the point where I needed to balance it out with some carbs. Very good deal overall and I had a good time.",4.0,"Aug 7, 2017"
"I cannot say enough good things about this fine establishment. First of all, when you walk into this restaurant you feel like royalty. Reminds me of that scene on the Titanic with the luxurious dining room with the gorgeous chandelier where Rose (meaning me,)graced everyone with her presence and charm (lol!) The restaurant is so massive that I am sure I did not see the full extent of it. My friends and I enjoyed taking many a selfie with the chandelier as a background on the beautiful stairway. Secondly, the food was outstanding and I pride myself of being a steak connoisseur, I have been to many Rodizio and steakhouses in all of NJ and NY and I live in an area densely populated by Brazilians and I know they're pros at making steak, I would know, I'm Uruguayan and steak/BBQ is our religion. I don't mean just eating muscle meat from the cow, we bbq it all: intestines (large and small), kidneys, Thymus glands, Tonsils, blood sausage etc! We eat the entire cow, not to mention we use their hooves to make cups and decorative pieces; that is more of a cultural thing than anything, but you get the point right?! The salad bar needs an honorable mention because it was one of the fullest salad bars in a Rodizio spot I've seen with the most delicious salad ingredients like hearts of palm, spicy peppers, all kinds of cheeses and dressings, prosciutto and smoked salmon, really freash veggies and fruits, you name it! The table was given caramelizad bananas and mashed potatoes and cheesy bread (my fave) all throughout the course of the meal. Thirdly and finally, the service was more than superb! Manuel the server was so accommodating and was very patient with my friend who could not make up her mind about what to order because she didn't have an appetite big enough for Rodizio. We had a great time thanks to Manuel and for us that had the Rodizio, he made sure that we were getting our preferred cuts of meat as frequently as possible. For dessert we tried the Tres Leches Cake because it was my BFF's birthday celebration dinner and it was delightful one of the best I've had! FIVE STAR DINING EXPERIENCE!",5.0,"Jul 28, 2019"
"Our team recently dined at Fogo de Chao for a luncheon. The atmosphere is modern elegant and the service was good. We started off at the salad bar which was loaded with great treats such as roasted vegetables, cheeses, meats and other nice appetizers. Then the meat began to flow. There was an endless parade of meats. Many cuts of beef, pork, chicken, lamb and even sausage. Most of the meats were mild on the salt, which idle good for me as I have a low tolerance for sodium. I've been to other Brazilian steak houses in the past and this ranks among the best of them. This is a good place for a large group or a intimate dinner date.",4.0,"Nov 20, 2019"
"Came here during a weekday and made a reservation for 8:30PM online. They're quite busy, so make sure you reserve in advance so you're guaranteed a decent time.The place itself is big with two floors. They sat us at an excellent table and explained the menu. We did the $70 rodízio deal that came with a buffet of good appetizers and fresh fruit. The salad bar was a lot bigger than most of the rodízio spots I've visited prior and everything on there that we tried was delicious. The meats came back to back! They're a lot faster than anywhere else I've gone to. They were very generous with the portions and the meat was so well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. Unlike other reviews I've seen, the waiters with the better cuts were frequenting all the tables. I must have had filet mignon and the picanha at least 4 times. I didn't try one thing that was over cooked and they were very good about giving us meat that was cooked as requested. Highly recommended restaurant. Great for families, friends, or date night. Plus, a cool add-on was that I won a free dessert from their scratch-off promo. Didn't get to use it this time (we were stuffed) but would def use it again soon.",5.0,"Apr 19, 2019"

"I discovered Fogo De Chao during my visit to Puerto Rico and absolutely loved it! They were amazing! Great customer service and the food was sssooo fresh and tasty. Good for children and families. My ten year old rave how amazing it was and would like to go back. As soon as I got back to NYC, I looked up Fogo De Chao and found they had a New York location. I made reservations through Opentable for my father birthday dinner in advance.So day of our reservation, I was contemplating on changing my reservation because my father had a broken his foot and had crutches. I knew it would be difficult to get around the market table, but I didn't want him to miss out on a Brazilian Steakhouse experience so I keep the reservation as is.Our reservation was on Thursday evening, It seem like they had a DJ and a nice crowd in for happy hour by the bar, music was on point. The dining  room is down one level they had a long staircase leading down, they also have elevators which we took. The hostess wanted to seat us far away from the market table and I'm thinking how I have to go back and forth for my father plate then mine. Then came Rogerio to the rescue, He waves down the hostess to seat us literally next to the market table. Thank you Rogerio for helping us out and being attentive. Francisco was our waiter and he was very sweet and always came to our table to check on us. Always asked if we needed anything and even asked if we had a favorite meat so he can send the server with that particular meat our way, which I thought was a great question to ask us. He even sent a dessert for my father birthday which was very thoughtful.Thank you to everyone who service us, your hospitality was amazing!",5.0,"May 30, 2019"
"Tip - Come HUNGRY.So glad I made a reservation weeks in advance for Restaurant Week dinner here! I love the concept of unlimited food, or unlimited meat for that matter. RW price for dinner was $42 per person and we ordered a pitcher of sangria for $40. The RW diners are not offered the higher quality meats, therefore I would want to come back just to enjoy the full experience next time. We were offered 3 types of beef (they only came around once), and the pork, chicken, lamb and sausage people came back repeatedly. The steaks were seasoned so well and extremely juicy - I wish we could've gotten more of it :( Once you flip your button to the green side, the meats just keep on coming. There is also a large salad bar with cheese, vegetables, fruits, rice and soup available to complement your meal. At the end, we could choose key lime pie, cheesecake or chocolate cake for dessert. Overall it was a wonderfully filling meal, and I really enjoyed the entire experience of this Brazilian BBQ restaurant.",4.0,"Aug 6, 2017"

"Fogo de Chão is an ""authentic"" Brazilian steakhouse (churrascaria) or as authentic as it gets around midtown.

"UNLIMITED SALAD AND SIDES. UNLIMITED BREAD. UNLIMITED MEAT. Yeah that's what you're getting. I personally think Fogo de Chao was very considerate to participate in Restaurant Week with a menu like that but it did the trick, it got my attention and now I know how amazing they are. Let's start with me being late for my table, It was difficult walking out there in terrible weather but I still insist on trying to show up. I showed up way past my reservation and they gave me a table anyways. I was so rushed, I didn't realize I was about to be brought down two flights of stair case to a big and beautiful dining area. Even though I knew I was there to chow down on plates and plates of meat like a baby dinosaur, something about the staircase and ambience made me feel a bit fancy. The feeling of feeling fancy went away right after my server said we're good to head to the salad and side bar for anything and everything! I was so ready to dig in. The salad and side bar was tricky, there was so many things I wanted to eat there but I knew I had to leave my appetite for the meat. Some highlights from the salad bar was their fresh vinaigrette, smoked salmon, chicken salad, and fresh mozzarella. The brazilian cheese bread, caramelized bananas, garlic mashed potatoes, and polenta that was served for each table was a miss for me. Now here comes the great part, the meat ..Picanha - the prime part of the top sirloin is their most popular cut and which ended up to be my FAVORITE! I usually don't eat sirloin, how did they make it so juicy and tender? Oh, and that layer of crispy crust sprinkled with flavor and then the fatty layer right before you bite into the medium rare insides of the meat, AMAZING. I think I can literally sit there throughout my meal and just eat this cut. Cordeiro - the leg of the lamb was really juicy and tender but could use some extra seasoning. I'm too used to having lamb chops and they're usually gamey but this piece of lamb was not gamey at all, so go for it even if you usually don't like lamb. Costela de Porco - they described it as tender pork ribs and cooked to perfection and indeed it was tender. It wasn't the fall right of the bone part (which I hate) but it was cooked just right. The Linguica (pork sausage) and Frango (bacon wrapped chicken breasts) were a hit or miss. The Alcatra (top sirloin) was a miss, it could've been my because my piece was more on the well done side and I prefer my meat more rare. The difference between the regular $60pp and the $38 RW menu is the prime meat selection. I ended the night with the choice of New York cheesecake, key lime pie, or chocolate mousse cake. Uh, can I have it all? Might as well make dessert unlimited too! It was a great experience, and I'll definitely be back restaurant week or not!",5.0,"Mar 5, 2015"

"I think this is one of the better Restaurant Week deals. The food is basically the same as a regular dinner with the exception of a few higher end proteins. But overall, it's very solid choice for RW. I came with a group of four and we were all pretty surprised how large the restaurant was, you really can fit a ton of people in there. One point of mention about their food, I have to give credit to their salad bar, their salad bar was pretty awesome. Their marinated mushrooms, asparagus, grilled veg, greens and gherkins were all great, the cheese wheel was a nice touch as was the charcuterie board. Overall, I enjoyed the food but it did find the food to be salty since I was pretty dehydrated later on in the evening. I also thought, even for RW, it was too expensive, I think you would have to eat yourself silly to justify the price.The food:Picanha- This is the signature item at all Brazilian rodizios, and this was my favorite item here. Picanha can generally be very hit or miss but the one here was extremely juicy and tender with a nice outer char.Alcatra-Top sirloin- This was my second favorite piece, it was really good and tender, it kinda had the look and feel of sliced brisket.Costela de Porco- Pork Ribs. I enjoyed this, it didn't have the most meat but I really liked the char from the rotisserie, I also really liked the seasoning on the ribs.Linguica- Pork sausage. I really liked their Lingiuica a lot, it had a really great mouth feel, it was nice and juicy and I loved the flavor.Chicken Leg- I normally don't say much about chicken, because it is chicken, but the one here was super juicy and tender. I hate to say it, but get the chicken leg lolGarlic Steak-  I am a little mixed about this one. While I enjoyed the tenderness of the meat, the seasoning was kinda off putting for me. It was some type of garlic paste but it had a weird flavor and left a weird feeling in my mouth afterwards.Fraldinha- Bottom Sirloin- This was just OK, it definitely was not as sexy as the Top Sirloin.Bacon Wrapped Chicken- The one thing I learned about riodizios is that bacon wrapped anything is usually disappointing. This was juicy and tender enough but it was missing the umph.Bacon Wrapped Steak- I think I preferred the bacon wrapped steak over the bacon wrapped chicken. The flavor was good, but like the above, it was missing that wow factor.Cordeiro- Leg of Lamb. This was my least favorite and the shocker piece. I love lamb and when I saw it, I thought I was going to love it, it was not as flavorful as I was hoping, it was actually kinda boring, really.",4.0,"Feb 19, 2017"
"Went to Fogo de Chao for dinner and had their 'Churrasco Experience' and I enjoyed every single part of it. And that's from the service to the food to the experience.You start off with the salad bar that provides more than just salads and various toppings. It also had several other sides includes rice and beans,bacon,soups,etc.The salad bar was amazing but don't fill up just on that. Once you get back to the table you can flip your sign and the servers will come by with various meats that they slice off onto your plate. They have everything from steak,to chicken,lamb,sausage,etc.It is all you can eat so the meat keeps coming until you are full.I definitely loved my dinner experience here and will 100% return once again!!",5.0,"May 8, 2019"

Right about when we got back from the salad area, our drinks arrived...the mango and habanero caiperinia was my favorite , though when the meat came I switched to red wine and they had a fantastic glass of Cab.The delicious meats are the reason to come. My personal favorite was the top sirloin and the house specialty picanyo (i think), which is apparently the most expensive cut of meat...more than filet mignon.We were stuffed by the end, so we skipped dessert and I walked home to burn some calories.",5.0,"Aug 29, 2017"

"RESTAURANT WEEK EXPERIENCELong anticipated visit to Fogo for my birthday. I think it was cool to experience one time but not good enough to go back. I think there are definitely better restaurants to try at this price point, but if you're a big meat eater and want that variety Fogo is lit.I'm sure this place gets absurdly busy at times so definitely make your reservation and be prepared to wait. Got here early for my reservation but we were seated 15 min later than our reservation time. The place is obviously super posh, but dress is casual.Our table was offered the restaurant week experience or the full experience (whole table must pick one), and the lady quickly explained how the place worked. The all-you-can-eat Market Table is self serve while the good stuff comes to you from waiters holding a stick of juicy meat. For restaurant week, we were offered chicken wings, parmesan pork chop, house sirloin, and pork ribs. It's nothing out of this world, but definitely a fair quality considering it is all-you-can-eat. I'm glad restaurant week gave me the opportunity to try Fogo, and to save my money from full price!",3.0,"Feb 11, 2017"
"Great food seasoned and cooked perfectly. And endless supply of meat until you finally say Uncle! Who could ask for more? The service is also top notch! Water glasses always full, plates changed as needed, dietary alleges taken care of. Best Churrascaria I have eaten at so far!",5.0,"Jul 8, 2019"
"My best friend and I haven't seen each other since the whole lockdown started so we decided to plan a reunion at her favorite go to spot Fogo de Chao! The patio is quiet with very few passersby and we got there for opening at 11:30 so we could have our choice of tables (though they are all well-spaced!). Instead of the buffet, waiters now serve salad bar items tableside, which I actually found to be a plus because I use a wheelchair and now I didn't have to deal with navigating a dining room with a plate of food! A charcuterie board, cheesey bread, and hot sides are also placed on your table. Then the gauchos start coming with all the meats! The filet mignon and picanha were my favorites and tend to come later in the meal so save room. We also got a glass each of our favorite Pinot Noir, A to Z.  Service and taste of everything was flawless. There is an accessible restroom down a ramp on the main level, and another on the lower level, which you have to take an elevator to get to.",5.0,"Aug 21, 2020"
"Honestly wanted to love this place a lot more. My boyfriend and I were super excited to try out this place but we left extremely disappointed. We both got the churrasco experience. To start, the service is excellent! The servers really take care of you and constantly come around with meats. The salad bar is also delicious and is kind of like a palette cleanser between the meats. They also gave us a complimentary strawberry cheesecake which was divine! Unfortunately everything else was less than pleasant. The food was the most unpleasant thing here. Hence the rating, we came here for the food. The meats were such a disappointment...literally no seasoning whatsoever and the flavor (or lack) was so blah. Tbh I could have cooked it better at home. Also there are a bunch of workers going around the tables trying to get you to buy drinks, shots, apps, etc. Do not fall into their traps. We took the shots because the guy made it seem like it was part of the experience but it was not. $26 for 2 (barely) shots. We spoke to the manager but she said that they said it upfront that it was not part of the churrasco experience...this is not what happened, at least not clearly at all. In any case, we learned and will not be returning",2.0,"Mar 1, 2022"

"It was my third time coming to Fogo de Chao (second time at NYC location) and every time I've visited, I came for restaurant week. Since my last visit in Summer 2018, they've improved. It's $42 for restaurant week and they offer a few less cuts of meat (filet mignon, ribeye, beef ribs), but honestly, you don't even realize you're missing those cuts. In the future, I'd rather coming during the summer than winter because the selection of fruits and vegetables at the salad bar were lacking compared to other times I came. Not their fault though. My favorite from the salad bar are cantaloupe melons paired with proscuitto (MUST TRY if you haven't heard of/tried the pairing before, it's an Italian classic!!) I'm not a fan of olives, but there's a lot of olive options.Last time, cuts of meat were a little inconsistent; either overly salty, or not seasoned enough, or overcooked and dry, etc. But this time around, none of that! Every cut I tried was perfectly seasoned and had lots of options of medium rare to medium well. My personal favorite cuts are the lamb steak, bottom sirloin and garlic steak. I would also skip on the top sirloin because it's the cheapest and leanest cut. Their service also improved as well- my glass of water was never past the half empty mark and the servers started remembering what cuts we were mostly going for. (Shout out to the guy who was serving the lamb steak, he gave me really thick pieces every time without asking after he heard me get excited over the lamb) Overall, I left happy, very full and satisfied! I would highly recommend for a unique steakhouse dining experience!",5.0,"Dec 24, 2017"
"We got here at opening time and it got full relatively fast. Service was excellent. The meats kept coming but you have to request the special meats like the filet mignon.  There were many various selection of meats including beef, chicken, and lamb. The quality of the meats were good. They were seasoned well and not overcooked. Definitely go when you're hungry and craving for meat because you will need to eat a lot!I recommend this restaurant to people who has a big craving for meats and like an AYCE experience.",5.0,"Feb 20, 2020"

"Although we made a reservation for a special occasion, we were placed in a back room which kept the servers with the meats from coming around. We would have to wave them down to come to our table even though we had our cards at green.  The servers paid more attention to the large tables and not the smaller ones. I noticed this across the board. Meats were seasoned and tastes fine. The market table had a decent selection and the drinks were strong. Just the service lacked. For the price we're paying, I expect more attentive service. I would rather go to Churrascaria de Plataforma that's nearby. Their service and food selections are much better.",5.0,"Oct 16, 2021"

Solid 4 stars. Came here for a big engagement party. Starters (bread/salad spread table area) were awesome! The meat itself too was spectacular. The lamb in particular was breathtaking! Service and ambiance were lovely as well. Would come back for sure!,5.0,"Oct 22, 2017"
"Still one of the most solid choices for steak in the city. They recently introduced some new cuts to the menu but I was only able to try the prime rib (from the new cuts), which was great. I usually stick to the fraldinha, picanha, alcatra and lamb (leg, chops) - and I am never let down. Make sure to always have some farofa (manioc flour), vinaigrette and hot pepper on your plate to make the experience more enjoyable. They keep bringing deep fried polenta and bananas to the table - don't miss that.Service was super kind, fast and attentive. At some point I asked for a specific cut to one of the waiters and in less than 3 minutes someone brought it directly to me from the kitchen, which was amazing. Price at lunch is very reasonable considering the quality here, and they also sometimes send coupons to people who join their email list",5.0,"Sep 20, 2017"
"Traditional Brazilian churrasco experience and consistent with the service they offer in Brazil. This is a must go place to deal with the craving for meat... the best part is that you can taste a large variety of small, different cuts - or you can stick to the ones you like the most. Everything at your own pace.I suggest passing the chicken, sausage and pork and sticking to the ""prime"" cuts such as fraldinha, picanha, lamb leg and lamb chops. All of those were impeccable. Feeling adventurous? Ask for the chicken hearts: this is something you definitely don't see in the US but very tasty and common in Brazil. But be advised that although very small, they are made to order and some 20 or 30 hearts arrive... A couple of traditional Brazilian things not seen here are the grilled mozzarella and garlic bread. You can find those in almost every churrascaria in Brazil, but not taking points of Fogo de Chao since in Brazil they also don't serve those.What (negatively) surprised me was the price... I went for lunch but instead had to pay for the dinner price as it was a holiday. I was not aware and no one made this clear upfront, which would be much appreciated. The lunch price offers a great value compared to the NY-style stakehouses where a beef for two can easily top $120. The dinner value? Not so much",3.0,"Jun 25, 2017"
"Really, in a good Brazilian Steakhouse, it's all about the sweet plantains...    From the minute you walk in to the time you leave you are completely surrounded in elegance. As far as Brazilian Steak-houses are concerned, I think this is number one.  You are greeted very cordially by the receptionist at the front desk and if you are not waiting will immediately go downstairs to their beautiful restaurant. where you are met by a host or hostess who will bring you to your table.  If you have to wait, they have a big beautiful spacious bar on he main level.  The restaurant is beautifully lit, not to bright with a very pleasant atmosphere.  The incredibly high ceilings (remember, your down a level,) keep the noise level extremely low.)O.K. So, they start by bring you the ""cheesy breads,"" delicious, but do not fill up on these as there will be massive amounts of food to come.  They have a huge wine list and also cocktails, beer and wine by the glass.   The wine cellar is very unique as it is part of the wall between the two floors.  I tried to get a tour but apparently they are not available.  I thought the per glass charge was a little pricey but not outrageous.Go to the sad bar...  pick up a plate and start...   Tomatoes, mozzarella, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes, check pea salad, sliced salmon, cheeses, roasted peppers, spinach salad, Iceberg lettuce, bacon, and more, more, more...  Again take and enjoy but remember there is going to be a whole lot more to come.  What I really find as a nice touch is that the team is always looking for the dirty plates on the table so you're never sitting with dirty place when you finish and inevitably go for more...Now the meats...   Plenty to choose from and they knew my wife liked medium well to well so they would bring over to my table quickly before they got distributed to another take where they really did not not it so well cooked.  Some of the meats include: lamb, bacon wrapped filet, chorizo, ribs, chicken legs and toward the end of the seating, they bring out the lamb chops.... all of them were cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor....  that's where Fogo excels, all there food is extremely flavorful and wonderfully prepared.   The sides include fried polenta, french fries, and a spicy mashed potato.   Now lets talk about the plantains....  They are PERFECT  (PERFECTLY PERFECT.) They're lightly fried and not breaded.  We can never get enough and luckily when they see an empty plate, the waiters bring new ones...  If they feel something was on the table too long, they bring a new one....  I can not speak about dessert since I have never left enough room to have it.  But... people tell me that the flan is to die for.On a scale of one to ten this restaurant is a SOLID TEN, but I only have five starts to work with so they get all five (plus the extra five in my head.)  Go, enjoy....",5.0,"Jan 4, 2015"

"Ordered from here about a month ago for takeout. Staff was polite. I ordered 2 ribeye medium rare, ice tea, and lemonade. They took a while to make the drinks so by the time I got the food, it was borderline medium to well done. They had the steak wrapped in alumium foil. On top of that, I barely even taste the salt. It felt as if they just put a pinch of salt on it. No other seasoning was used. On the bright side, the steak was cut up and ready to eat. Unfortunately, it tasted bland and I couldn't down it anymore after 3 pieces. Extremely disappointed. If you're considering getting steak to go, don't.",4.0,"Mar 9, 2015"

"Came here for Restaurant week to try it out. The place is fancy and nice looking. The restrooms are clean and fancy. The service is awesome, they are on top of your needs and they are always watching to your needs. The salad bar is great: great variety of foods and they are all fresh. What I liked the most is the smoked salmon with avocado in the side. The meat was ok... It was as you would expect from a Brazilian buffet: they come with meat and serve you with different types of meat (filets, strips, chicken, sausages, etc). But, I feel that the meat from ""Rio Grande Churrascaria"" was much better: better made and tastier. This place overall is great, but I would definitely recommend you to ""Rio Grande Churrascaria"" for the meat instead!",4.0,"Dec 25, 2018"
The Strawberry Hibiscus Cahprini was very good! Salad bar was nice but I would have like more veggies. A nice variety of meats but I found a few to be quite salty.

The gaucho (market table) lunch is an amazing deal. Price increases if you want to add grilled meat by it's still a steal! For lunch, take your pick from the buffet and go as many times as you want.

"Came in with a girlfriend for restaurant week to take advantage of the buffet of meat. I've been to a Brazilian steakhouse before so I knew what to expect - this time I remembered to flip my card. The sides/salad bar was a bit disappointing for me personally because I didn't like/want most of the options available.

The rest being filet mignon, rib eye, ny strip, regular sirloin, pork chop, lamb shank, pork sausage, chicken.",4.0,"Nov 21, 2016"
"Great service, just definitely not what I was expecting for $100. Staff were great, but I would not visit here again. You have to use the same plate for all the meat you get, instead of getting a new one. I had a few pieces of meat I tried and did not like that was sitting on my plate until I got dessert. I'm shocked that they don't take it and offer you a new one when they see your not gonna eat it. The cokes I had tasted a bit odd but I love coke, so I didn't complain. Kinda tasted flat and they did not put enough ice in the drinks so it wasn't as cold as expected. The crème brûlée was not that great. I expected it to be sweeter, but was just blah. The burnt sugar on top was disgusting. It tasted like it was some artificial sugar that was not sweet at all and was bad. Some of the meat was cool temp wise when it was cut. Was Definitely not expecting that. I expected hot fresh meat. And I was NOT offered every kind of meat that was listed on the menu. Mashed potatoes were amazing. The cheese bread had no flavor to it. I was extremely disappointed in this place. And that I spent $100 made the experience worse. It was not worth anywhere near $100. And I did not like the fact that I had to go downstairs and get sides from a buffet area. This is supposed to be a nice restaurant, it felt like I was at a golden coral, except you had no idea what some things were. Lots of things did not have labels at all. One thing I tried tasted very sour and I know for a fact that it should not taste that way. If I could go back in time, I would have canceled my reservation and got some food from a street cart. That food is much better than here. Extremely disappointed. This ruined my expected thanksgiving ""dinner"" here. Will not be back.",1.0,"Nov 25, 2021"

"Pros:* The decor and ambiance at Fogo is spectacular- magnificent glass-encased open wine cellar hanging over main dining room. The regal silverware and fabric tablecloths certainly elevated our dining experience. * The starter Cheesy Mochi Balls are addicting and I had to stop myself from eating them to save room for meat. My favorite items from the salad bar were prosciutto, lox, manchego cheese, scalloped potatoes, mozzarella balls, and spicy pickled cherry peppers (if they were filled with goat cheese, game over). * Most tender, flavorful and juicy meats were the NY Strip steak, all ribs, and mini chicken drumsticks. Cons:* Overall, I think that the quality and variety of the food at Fogo is good, but can be a LOT better (especially to match the price & upscale ambiance). The options served at the salad bar at Fogo de Chão is meager compared to, say, the bar at Churrascaria Plataforma- which serves many more hot dishes such as risottos and pastas. The sides of crispy hot polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas didn't blow me away. Some meats were a bit on the dry/overcooked side.",4.0,"Feb 3, 2017"
"This is a Restaurant Week '17 review I love Brazilian Steakhouses and I've been dying to go to this one for ages. It's a bit out of my price range for a normal dinner so when I saw they were participating in Restaurant Week I jumped. $42 for several courses of meat, unlimited salad bar / set side dishes, and dessert is a total steal. The only time I had a similar experience was at this Argentinian place in Hackensack that burnt down a week after I went there and Yelped it 5 stars RIPANYHOW, I had a good time over here at ol Fogo de Chão - the salad bar had a great selection of various cheeses, vegetables, salads, and even some prosciutto and salami. The plantains, the mashed potatoes and the pop-over-esque bread were amazing. As for the cuts of meat themselves - it was a satisfying variety of various types of meat, the stand outs were the sirloin cuts, the excellent garlic steak, the parmesan pork chop and those like, whats its, the meat cuts in the Yelp photo. Those guys. Yeaaaaaaaaah.All in all, good times. Nothing blew my mind, I think if I had paid full price I would have been a little disappointed... though I presume Restaurant Week doesn't get the mind-blowing meat picks. However, FOR a Restaurant Week pick, this was aces.",3.0,"Jun 15, 2019"
"Going to start by saying the food itself was great. Definitely try the cheesy bread and caramelised bacon. Just amazing. The meat is cooked perfectly (albeit the filet mignon not being as tender as it should be). The main problem was the service itself. If you're going as a couple - be prepared to sit under the stairs (that's where all the 2 people places are). The stairs wasn't the issue itself, it's that the meat never gets to you. By the time they reach you (or are meant to), they need to reheat or outright get a new slice, which most of the time meant they would start from the top again and repeat said process. Towards the end I got frustrated and had to keep asking the waiters to explicitly bring various meats to the table because otherwise they'd never reach us.So takeaways from this:Food is 10/10Service is 2/10If you plan to go then go with 3+ people to be seated where they will reach you.",4.0,"Dec 15, 2014"

"Came here with my girlfriend to have dinner for our last day while staying in south beach. Overall we had a very good experience here. The selection of meats for the rodizio was amazing. We started with the salad bar and then went on to flip the button over to the green side so we can begin to enjoy what we came here for. The first item we tried was the filet and it was one of the best cuts we've ever had. Then we tried lamb chops (sad to say we only got to try it one time, as it was delicious. Nobody ever came around with it more than that one time). Then we had top sirloin which was tasty. The bottom sirloin tasted better than the top sirloin, even though most times I'd say the opposite. The Parmesan-crusted pork was amazing and I wish I was able to eat pork more often than I do. The churrasco was too bloody so I gave it another try the next time around and that piece was a perfect medium. The pork rib seemed a bit dry and the bacon-wrapped chicken and beef were also a bit dry. The ribeye had lots of flavor and I enjoyed every bit of it. The staff were all great and I learned that the restaurant also has a NYC location and I plan on making a reservation to go there within the next few months.

"An experience I will never forget!!  I came here for a yelp event!! It was such a great experience. Let's start with the wonderful formal sit down setup. The formal setting read ""get comfortable there's about to be a feast"". The warm up:Ok this was the cheesy bread. Which was just warm, light and full on delicious. Then the wine started. We had the option between red or white wine.Main:We started with a buffet style salad bar. It was filled with veggies, pasta, cheese and a few meats. Then here comes the meat. We were severed 17 different kinds of meat. To be honest I lost count after about the 6th one. So I'm not sure if all 17 made an appearance. I tried the pork ribs, rib eye, New York strip, sirloin, crispy chicken and chicken wrapped bacon. To top it off we had sides to go along with the meat as if out plates weren't already full from the salad bar. The sides were mashed potatoes, plantains and palenta fries. Throughout the feast..yes I said feast!! Our wine glasses were being filled if we wanted it. I left before the dessert and to be honest if I was still there I didn't have any room. Now let's discuss the service. It was GREAT!! They were courteous and so friendly. My table didn't hesitate leaving a tip. Recommendation: I would most certainly recommend this to friends.

"Fogo de chao NY is one of the best Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been. The service was great, staff was on point and extremely friendly. Meat was just as I like it (they made sure to asked how I wanted it done!), with a great variety to pick! Salad bar was also perfect. And DO NOT FORGET to save some room for a brazilian dessert!I definitely recommend this location if you're in the city!!!",5.0,"Mar 3, 2019"

First off all the energy was great off the walk in. Per COVID 19 regulations there has to be outdoor seating which was fine because the outdoor seating was very nice . Our waiter(s) one of 3 who's name was Christian was super friendly and upbeat and showed us the menu and was a down right sweetheart . A young woman who name I didn't get came after Christian who was blonde-Ish and was a absolute delight as well . Our waiter who was bringing out the food was really nice & because I was vegetarian ---  he Was making sure I was getting my money worth of salads and sides etc . My friends ordered an option which is basically all you can eat and they both reveled at the food and the customer service as well . We came later as the sun was going down . The vibe was very ambient and not really loud considering it's location in Midtown. I would come here a zillion times over because not many places have superb customer service like this place is unbelievably great . This place has the best customer service I've ever had and I came here by chance !!  . I love it and every second I was here . I will 100000000% coming back soon .,5.0,"Jul 21, 2020"

"Wowwwwwwww!!! Wowwww! Wowww!!!I took my boyfriend here yesterday for date night and it was an amazing experience. We have never eaten here before prior to yesterday. We did the churrasco experience and did not regret it one bit. Everyone at this establishment was so incredibly nice it made the experience so much better. We got our food served at the buffet setup from a very nice gentle who answered all the questions we had. We filled our plates up with food and we weren't even able to finish because of all the meat coming around and my boyfriend and I could eat our asses off. Besides the food you get from the buffet you also get mashed potatoes, polenta fries and sweet plantains. Everything was AMAZING. I had never had polenta fries and they're my new favorite food. Sadly I didn't take any pictures because I was hangry when I got there and was too entertained by the food. The Moral of this review is: YOU HAVE TO GO HERE!",3.0,"Mar 18, 2022"
"Me and my partner were really excited to try out this place.We ordered two Churrasco experiences. The salad  bar was wonderful. All of the meat in general was okay although they were a little too much for us so we wanted to get the check after we finished our 8-9th meat offer. Upon asking for a check, our waiter didn't seem content. We paid with 2 gift cards and cash and waited a little bit. Seeing no one was coming to pick up our payment, we intended to head out as we left the payment as well as tips on the table. When we were heading out, our waiter chased after me saying that they needed time to process the cards before we could leave, which I happily accepted and waited. I then told him that he can go process the cards and I would call my partner back, seeing that he's already far from where we were standing and he was also in a phone call. Yet, the waiter didn't seem to believe me and insisted on calling him back with his loud voice and beckoning sign for 2 minutes straight. This gesture felt rude to us as customers who just wanted to be served and treated normally. After my partner got back, we temporarily sat down at an empty table, since the way back to our table was pretty crowded and we thought it would be quick to process our payments. Our waiter came back just to yell at us that we needed to move because they were gonna sit other customers down. We went back to our table as he forced us to, feeling angry and mistreated for an $170 meal. Our gift cards went through and we left him tips. We were fairly happy with the food and the atmosphere. However, our waiter's attitude ruined our experience at Fogo de Chão. We hope this would be improved in the future.",5.0,"Dec 6, 2020"

"Review is limited to service solely- food is exceptional. We were a large party. Initially, the host who took our order was more concerned with making sure those who only ordered ""Market Place"" (a/k/a no meat) were not in violation and refrained from partaking in the Brazilian meats.  When we were shown to our table there were a number of open water bottles on the table- the host and waiter said nothing about the fact that they will charge you $7.50 per bottle. Only became aware when we were provided the check. Three quarters  through our meal, plates were piling up and no one came by to collect the dirty dishes. It wasn't until I literally had to bring my dirty dish to a server did they begin to take our dirty dishes away. Be aware if you don't want to be charged $7.50 per water bottle- ask for tap!",5.0,"Feb 6, 2022"
"Very fun experience at Fogo de Chao. Went for restaurant week and on a Wednesday, which made it a great deal due to the 50% off wine bottles and $42 prix-fix menu for restaurant week. Starts with salad bar, full of fruit, cheese, bread, and then right away the meats start coming in. We had lamb, steak, chicken, and overall had a great time and definitely did not leave the restaurant hungry. Definitely not an every week restaurant to go to but really fun to go once in a while.",4.0,"Nov 17, 2018"
"Fogo, I've been here 3 times and service is hit or miss. Service was certainly better in the private room with the diamond package at 176 a plate but more on that later.Meat seems to be cooked medium rare on the weekends and a bit drier on weekdays, just my observation after 3 or 4 visits.Service was prompt and quick with open bar ending one hour and forty five minutes after starting, they are strict. Splitting the bill was not easy, it took over an hour and fogo over charged us so our server had to redo the bill a few times, I think we saw 3 iterations of a bill. I came in here at 7pm, it is currently after 11pm and I'm still waiting for my check and we have no more drinks! First world problem, I know but I wouldn't be complaining if I had a drink to sip on while I chat with my friends. Do yourself a favor and check your bill as well as pay on a single card. They are not equipped to split the check several ways.For the record, their competitor platforma was smooth, efforless and a pleasant experience. Even green fields was effortless. Fogo can do better.

"Nice place, but could work on a few things. For a party of 2, we were seated all the way in the back near the kitchen on a table of 4. As we walked in, we were held standing in front of the others, while the staff tried to figure out where to seat us, which was a big disappointment considering the price you pay here. Not only were we placed away from everyone, and given a bigger table, the staff seemed to ""hang out"" in the back, which was a little annoying. Impossible for a romantic dinner when staff is huddled up behind you chatting away, and extremely hard to focus on a conversation especially if your there for business. Besides that, the service was excellent.Love the place card concept. green means keep the food coming and if you flip it over to red, it will stop the food from coming. A great way to eat at YOUR OWN pace. The food is served fresh, and cut to perfection. The staff is extremely aware and you will not be waiting long for someone to notice you turned your card overSalad bar was confusing, they could've done better with the setup. Unorganized placement of cheeses, meats and salad. They were pretty much just mixed any and everywhere. *Would return during lunch hours, a much better deal for your pockets.",3.0,"Nov 20, 2016"

Super friendly service and very welcoming to young children. In fact kids under 6 eat free!!Beef ribs were awesome. In fact we weren't disappointed with any of the beef. The chicken was also  tasty.

Great salad bar that I would also take it easy on because you need to leave room for the meats. Amazing variety of meats that never ends. You can choose how you prefer them cooked and flip over your little card if you have the meat sweats and need to digest a little and don't want them to come over to you. Besides the food, the drinks are also great. My husband is always saying we have to go back here and I can't wait!",5.0,"Sep 5, 2020"
"I've been here twice, and each time did the job! Flip the card to ""Go"" and let the meats come to you.There is a substantial salad bar which includes creamy cheeses, smoked salmon, and other well executed vegetables and salads to go with the meats. Meat wise, I've never been disappointed, although there are some that I've learned to skip such as the chicken and filet mignon wrapped in bacon. Some slices were a little too salty for my liking, but my boyfriend enjoyed these since he often adds salt to his steak (why!!). But for the price and the amount of food you get, I think this is a great deal. I learned to stick with the rib eye, sirloin, and filet mignon cuts. Try to stay away from the cheese bread and potatoes-they will fill you up! Stick with the meats and cleanse your palate with some sweet bell peppers or pickled jalapeños.",4.0,"Dec 7, 2016"
"Been here many times; this review is only about their service during Restaurant Month. The best restaurant service I've ever had.  Here's why.1. We were about 10 minutes early for dinner based on our reservation, but were seated immediately anyway.  You hear horror stories of reservations not being honored all the time.2.   The table was properly set and the staff leading us to our table pulled the chairs back.  A waiter then came a minute or two later to welcome us and take our drink/water orders right away, while putting menus in front of us.  You hear more horror stories about wait staff never coming to greet and take orders until just minutes before you die from old age.3. As this was a rodizio, she inquired whether we knew the routine.  I replied yes but since my friend was new to it, I asked that she explain the process anyway.  4. We informed her we wanted the Restaurant Month option and she told us the cost, what it included and what it did not.  Many times the different choices are not fully disclosed; you only learn certain items are excluded when later on you ask where they are and it is then revealed they're not available on that option.  Transparency is always a good thing, especially up front.5. After making our choices (Restaurant Month, tap water, soda) our water glasses were promptly filled.  My glass never went below half full (empty) the entire night.  The soda came in a bottle and was poured into a glass with ice; the remainder in the bottle was left with us. Strangely, no one asked alter on if we wanted a refill, which we would've liked; we thought that's how restaurant make their money ($4/soda, etc.) 6. The dinner begins with a fabulous help yourself salad bar--definitely not your grandma's old salad bar.  Items included prosciutto, marinated mushrooms, mozzarella on tomato, every imaginable green salad and add-on, caramelized bacon, and tons more.  Stacks of clean plates were readily available; some buffets run out of plates!  All items were replenished before emptying, except for the crazy good candied bacon.  Many buffets are slow at replenishing items, especially the more expensive or popular ones  (BTW no crab legs for hoarders here).  All necessary plates and utensils were laid out; soup bowls, spoons, separate ladles.  A sneeze guard fully covered this very large salad bar.  The warm dishes were kept warm; e.g. rice, soup, feojada.7. A bowl of cheesy bisquits/bread was placed on our table.  That bowl was replaced with fresh warm bread maybe four times during our meal, any time the bowl dwindled down to one bisquit.  After the first refill, we didn't have to ask for more--it was automatic.8. Once our indicator turned over from red to green, the meats starting coming.  The servers with their skewers were never more than five minutes apart and we had an opportunity to sample each and every item.  Even this fine establishment seemed on other occasions to hold back on the finer cuts, but not this night.  Every meat came around two or three times.  Every degree of doneness--medium to very rare.  When the server ran out of rare garlic steak, he promised to come back with a rare piece--which he did only a few minutes later!  That's personal service.  Whether we asked for half the usual slice or two slices, they accommodated us. The rare was truly rare.8. Dirty plates were constantly taken away. In fact, we were asked at least five times if we wanted to have removed an extra plate we used for fat, grizzle, bones and other detritus.  It is rare too that plates are cleared so frequently.  One waiter displayed acute attention to minutia when he saw me playing with an after-dinner mint wrapper that was buried in my hand and offered to discard it.   9. During our meat orgy, sides came out.  We could have easily forgotten about them in the meat frenzy.  While we were ""only"" asked once how the meal was or if we needed anything else, our waitperson was never more than a table or two away.  We never had a problem getting her attention.   10.   When we stopped the meat attack, no one asked if we wanted coffee or dessert.  Again, we thought the extras were a profit center for eateries.  The check then came fairly quickly.  We paid and left and some one must have thanked us, but it was so busy and noisy, such an omission was forgivable and could be overlooked.11. There wasn't any aspect of service that was lacking.  Some places refold your napkin or wipe your place until crumb-free, but those touches do not define service, and are only a couple of items.  The overall service here with its many facets was top notch. There was always a sense of wanting to serve exhibited subtly by every waiter, busboy and host; totally absent was any air of snobbiness or disdain. I can't recall any other place meeting practically all of the many features that comprise ""service.""  For those who can't understand how bad service can be, try Demarchelier.",5.0,"Sep 15, 2019"
"Have been here several times.  The last two times (separated by about 6 months)  were during Restaurant Week -- prices (now $42 for dinner) having increased on our second visit recently, but still much less expensive than regular prices ($62).  Salad choices were average for a Manhattan rodizio.  Shiitake mushrooms were hard to find.  The little biscuits were outrageously good, but appetizers (mashed, plantains and polenta were totally unnecessary).   Meats were limited (eg no lamb chop, chicken hearts, filet mignon or beef ribs)   Meats were still good, rare was available,but pork ribs were not..  Plenty to choose from and amazingly undersalted.  Ambiance, service, restrooms all 4/5 stars.  Coffee $3.25, soda $3.50.  Dessert was very thin sliver of chocolate mousse cake and key lime pie.  At least, they're consistent.",4.0,"Feb 9, 2017"
"Two of us had the $25 (usually $39) lunch during Restaurant Week.  Best deal of all time!  We thought the rodizio meats would be limited but there were 12:  top and bottom sirloin, house special steak, pork ribs, lamb, chicken leg, chicken wrapped in bacon, sausage, parmesan encrusted pork, garlic and regular seasoned steak, no beef ribs came around tho.  Buffet bar had shiitake mushrooms, feojada, prosciutto, salami, smoked salmon--plus all components of salad including no fat bacon, many different salads and a wonderful basil dressing among others.  Meats were offered rare to well done, salted liberally. Everything--steaks, chicken, pork, lamb were tender and moist, not dried out or tough. You get 3 sides:  mashed potatoes, fried bananas, and polentas.  Dessert included: chocolate mousse cake, key lime pie or NY cheesecake.  Coffee was $2.65.  Drinks start at around $14.  Service was attentive but not intrusive.  Waiters were friendly and efficient. Plates were removed timely and water promptly refilled.  Sometimes the skewers did not make it to our end and it could be a wait before that meat returned, but there was always enough to munch on while waiting.  The setting was very attractive, contemporary, well-lit, not overly noisy.  Lots of room down winding stars..  Clean toilets on dining level..  About as a good a dining experience of that type (rodizio, buffet) as you'll likely find, especially for that price in Manhattan.  Only complaint was no seafood.",5.0,"Jul 23, 2014"
"Fogo is very fancy spot so dress a little nicer than you would normally; if you care like that. Enter right off the Main Street into a beautiful lobby where you can wait at a cute little bar or go straight downstairs to the dining area.Come hungry! This place offers unlimited table side service of delicious meat cuts and an open salad bar. It was an overwhelming experience with waiters busting back n forth offering slices of all kinds of meat and baskets of warm bread (my favorite). The mashed potatoes were so good! I could get enough.. no literally. I asked and asked for more but the waiter never brought more to the table so I could only think of how delicious the first small portion was. At the end of my unlimited dining experience when I could stand the sight of meat anymore we were offered a selection of desserts that all looked so good. I could only choose one unless I wanted to eat myself into a good coma. The bill for 4 people came to about $400 with tip which is pricey but worth it for the food and experience alone. It's not something I would do often but once in a while would be nice. Random side note, the bathroom has the softest most plush paper towels. It's the good stuff lol !

Ahhhh!Yes, that's the sound of me unbuttoning my top trouser button and letting the elastic on my boxers expand so that I can breathe.Came to this gorgeous restaurant to celebrate a birthday (not mine) with friends and had a very enjoyable evening.  Drinks were very good, specifically the Caphirinas!  Salad bar was great, though missing seafood items that I anticipated based on other places I've been.  I have to say the tiny red peppers I ate were the best I've ever had.Meats were very good. Standouts were the parmesan crusted pork, bacon wrapped chicken (which I kept calling ""chicken wrapped bacon""-must have been the Caphirina!)  There were sides of polenta, mashed potatoes and something else, but who cares...I'm not there for starches!And again, the space is beautifully designed and not too loud.  Service was consistently good. Alas, it's super spendy.  Three people, two drinks each and splitting one dessert was over $300.I still think Churrascaria Plataforma has a slight edge in the food department, because there was a dearth of seafood on the salad bar here and I like me shrimps!

Wow! What a great restaurant especially to those who enjoy a Brazilian steakhouse. The temperature of the meat served was perfect. My family and I made reservations and showed up 15 mins early. We were seated right away. Our waiter was extremely busy so our table was well taken care of by a manager. She did not let us go without.

"I took my partner out to Fogo for his birthday. I can most definitely say I was very disappointed. Checking in was pretty easy. Once seated, there was always a constant breeze from upstairs because their revolving door was closed or broken. This alone made it uncomfortable to take off your coat and get ready to eat. We decided to go with the market bar option. It looked so unorganized, and looked very aesthetically unappealing. It did not taste great either. We had ordered one still water and one sparkling... they brought us two of each, but wouldn't even come around to fill the still until it was empty. Our tabs were turned to the green side for a long time because we came for that experience, but we had to reach out to the waiter to ask why we were not even getting anything. To top off the experience, there was a table of young adults in the table next to us, and one of the young men at the table kept fondling himself. This was not what I expected at all. For what we paid and expected, this was just a very disappointing experience. Do better.",1.0,"Feb 15, 2022"

"This is the first first to hit for RW this season. Unfortunately, I made the poor decision of having two slices of pizza 2 hours before having dinner at Fogo. Unlike my dining partners who one had 3 cookies all day and the other had a yogurt for lunch. So when we sat down at our table, I was worried I wouldn't eat my money's worth. We hit the salad bar. It wasn't an amazing selection but it had the basics. I particularly love the kale salad. It took a while before the carved meat was offered at our table. It started with the garlic steak which was amazing. However, it never came back around. I also like the sirloin steak. I tried the parmesan pork and it was dried. We had originally declined the lamb because we wanted to finish what we had. The lamb miraculously never stopped by again. Every time the guy would walk right past our table and not even make eye contact. We tried to tell the wait staff if they could have the lamb over as that was the last type of meat we wanted to try. It took 3 people later for the lamb to finally be over. However, the wait was not worth it. My dining partners thought the lamb tasted gamey. I thought it lacked seasoning. Oh well. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse cake. It was not bad for a RW included dessert. I would love to try the peach cream next time. I think the medium cuts of any of the beef at Fogo are probably better choices than the chicken, pork, or lamb. I'm taking a point of because the service is subpar, but if you want decent selection of meat in one sitting, this is the place to be. If you want top quality beef cuts, of course, this is not the place to go.",5.0,"Nov 29, 2020"

"Ate here twice. First one was their restaurant week which I enjoyed a lot. Today, my husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here. since he wants it special he opted to reserve the full churrasco experience instead of the brazilian experience. Waaaayyy pricier I said but wanted to try. When we got there, we were seated near the staircase and fire extinguisher, I felt our table is somewhat a location inside the restaurant that you always overlooked. Also, some staffs are friendly,some were a bit of a snob. We were expecting that we could eat the meat cuts that brazilian experience doesn't offer,but to our dismay, the meats that were being served on our side is always same meat that we had tried and the cuts that were also offered for their brazilian experience.

"Came here for lunch during the week! I think they are doing great with protocols during COVID (no menus, no green/red signs). Although, I did think it was a bit awkward having to wait at the Market Table/salad bar for someone else to put the food on my plate. ""I'd like 3 pieces of this, a small scoop of that, wait no a little more..."" But I guess they are doing the best they can do during these difficult times. The waiter was friendly and helpful. We will be back!",4.0,"Nov 16, 2020"
"Just went here for my anniversary. Omg this place is amazing!! The food is so good!! My favorite of the night was the pork ribs and the baby lamb chops. My boyfriend was a huge fan of the sirloin. It's was so cool having the option to try so many different meats. My partner and I joked that we felt like royalty just having people come up to us and ask us if we wanted this meat, what cut, how much, etc.  Really recommend this place especially if you are having a celebration of any kind! For us, our waiter actually asked if we were celebrating anything and when we said anniversary he made sure to get us a free dessert (which was of course delicious)! I will definitely be back to place!! P.S come hungry - they're all you can eat is no joke.",5.0,"Dec 25, 2018"
"Close but no cigar.  I'm a bit torn on this review so I decided to up it to four stars.  We decided to come here after touring the city and craving something to eat.  I wanted to choose a place that most of everyone in our group was familiar with--a Brazilian steak house.  Normally, being in New York I try to stay away from chains, but based off of the people in or party I knew that night wasn't a night for experimenting.We initially made reservations but ended up arriving a bit earlier.  Of course, we were greeted and seated and given menus.  The salad bar wasn't anything to really right home about.  There was the usual fare, the salads, the smoked salmon, cheese and some cold vegetable appetizers as well as I believe from first glance ether minestrone or vegetable soup.  Nothing really stood out from there.  I added rice to my place and a few greens and sat down and eagerly waited for the meats!And yes, they have the meats!  The meat that stood out was the pork ribs, they were seasoned very well.  I also enjoyed the prime rib.  The service was so/so, again nothing to brag about.  The sides were good, not sure if the mashed potatoes are real or powdered.  They tasted powdered.  Please use real potatoes or upgrade the potato flake brand--this place costs a pretty penny.  Speaking of which, you are in the heart of Manhattan so expect to pay out some serious cash.  Whatever discount you have, use it.  The atmosphere is nice, smart casual I think is a good recommendation.",4.0,"Jan 2, 2019"
"Excellent restaurant, I love the decor I love idea I love the food!I came here for my anniversary,And truly enjoyed our dinner,All you can eat meats there was so many and they kept coming!

Asked another waiter for our check.",3.0,"Nov 30, 2016"
"I took my husband and mother-in-law here for my husband's birthday dinner. STAY AWAY. I have never in my life experience such bad service.When sitting down, the waiter spoke to us like he was doing us a favor for being there. He was not nice at all. He did not introduce himself and walked away with an attitude.They don't communicate at all. You don't know who is your waiter. You'll get asked by 5 different waiters if you want water or if you're ready for the check. After i had asked for the check and gave in my debit card, we were sitting waiting for it. Someone that looked like that manager came up to the table and asked ""Is there anything else you are waiting for?"" Sort of like kicking us out. I can't make this up.The worst of all, I had requested a birthday desert in advance. When one of the waitresses came to offer a desert menu, i secretly got up and spoke to one of them and i reminded them that i had requested a birthday dessert. The girl said she'll find out and i went to sit.THEN SHE COMES TO THE TABLE AND ASKS ME OUTLOUD ""Did you ask for the birthday dessert in advance or just now?"" ??????? Why would you go up to the table and ask this so loudly when i obviously went in secrecy  ? i mean common sense????? I told them to forget it. That it was supposed to be a surprise.I had ordered a creme brulee and my mother in law got a cheesecake, my husband did not order a dessert.They put a candle and a ""Happy Birthday"" on the cheesecake.. which was once again for my mother in law.Seriously, i do not understand how this place holds up with this service. The food is not cheap, and the place is nice. For sure get better staff. I would never set foot in this place ever again and i sincerely recommend no one does either.",1.0,"Apr 9, 2018"
This place was amazing. The service was great and the waiters were very polite. The decor in the restaurant was very nice and I loved all the wine bottles on the wall. The salad bar was unreal and had so many choices; the candied bacon was my favorite. The meat was delicious but I would have liked the waiters to come more frequently with the meats as I felt there were some times I was waiting for more meat. The wine was delicious and next time I would try a seafood appetizer. Overall loved it and would definitely come back for a special occasion.,5.0,"Jan 23, 2022"
"Two words: MEAT HEAVEN. Come hungry, people!I came here for lunch on a Sunday to celebrate a friend's birthday. We made reservations beforehand, but the place wasn't too crowded and there was plenty of seating. We had the Full Churrasco Experience which includes unlimited tableside meat, the market table and feijoada bar, and some side dishes for about $47 per person. We started off with some virgin drinks for my non-alcoholic drinking ladies and cheese bread. Do yourself a favor and ask for more. It's unlimited and it's good. Market Table and Feijoada Bar: A plethora of cold veggies, salad bar, fruit, cheese, cured meats, soups, and other side dishes.Tableside meat: Continuous tableside servings of chicken, lamb, and beef..basically a food eaters dream. After stuffing ourselves with meat (seriously people, bring your fat pants) we ordered icecream and the chocolate mousse cake. The cake was as one would imagine..chocolatey goodness. I regret ordering the icecream though..literally got 2 scoops for $10...could've bought a pint of Haagen Daz instead. Anyway..mistakes!Overall, I'd come here every now and then if I had a meat craving. It beats going to outback..unless rubbery steaks are your kinda thing.",4.0,"Jan 8, 2019"
"Disappointing compared to the Philadelphia location. Prices were higher yet the meat and service were subpar.I love Fogo and it's always been an amazing experience everytime I go in Philly so I was super excited when I found out there was a New York location. But I should have never went.The servers barely paid attention to us, we felt like we had to constantly hunt them down to bring us the meats. When they did, it was really dry and salty. It was also my friends birthday and I made a note of that on the reservation and even went and told the server while we were there. He made sure that they would include a candle on our dessert. But as expected - we didn't.I'm sticking to Philly.",2.0,"May 24, 2018"

"$60 a head for dinner might sound steep, but it's more than worth every penny for a dining experience that is unforgettable in every way.Sure, the never-ending parade of delicious meats is amazing and the real reason you come here, but the thing that surprised and wowed me the most was the incredible service. It was seriously the best service I've received at any restaurant in recent memory, including any fine dining and non-buffet establishments.From the moment you arrive, every single member of the huge staff treats you like royalty, showing you to your seats, taking your jacket for you and putting it on your chair or checking it, and helping you into your seat. After that, they will ask you if you've been there before - you should just say yes and don't make the mistake I did, as it wastes a valuable minute that you could be gorging on the delicious meats going around the room and enjoying the beautiful salad bar.To save you those few minutes, they will just explain to you how you have a Green card and a Red card, which are pretty self-explanatory - leave it on Green the whole time to make sure they keep on bringing on the meat.So first make your way to the salad bar, which luckily has a lot of lighter fare, to offset the pounds of heavy meat and beige you will be eating otherwise. Oh yeah, and a giant, overflowing bowl of pure bacon. Yup, huge, crispy strips of bacon. This place is great.By the time you get back to your table, there is a fresh basket of Pao de Queijo waiting for you (cheesy bread), which is delicious. Once it loses its heat though, you should make sure to ask for a fresh basket, which they will be more than happy to bring you. Once the meat starts flowing, they also bring you endless amounts of the three available sides: Caramelized Bananas, Crispy Polenta, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. To go along with all that beige, make sure to also get some Rice & Black Beans from the salad bar. These sides aren't the best, so I would probably avoid them in favor of saving more room for the huge variety of meats.Speaking of the meat, it's pretty much all great. And by great, I mean extremely juicy and tasty, but also some of it VERY salty. There is a helpful menu on the table detailing the huge number of cuts available, though there are even some more not listed. Among the ones I tasted that were really great were the Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Bottom Sirloin, Parmesan-Encrusted Pork, Ribeye, Pork Ribs, Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon and Chicken, Lamb Chops, Marinated Chicken Legs, Pork Sausages, Picanha, Beef Ribs, and their Fogo Steak house specialty. It was mostly a blur of meat, but I vaguely recall the sirloins and the filet mignon, as well as the parmesan-encrusted pork being the standouts. You also must try the bacon wrapped filet mignon or chicken, which are also among the best.After several minutes of difficulty with breathing, I finally realized we should probably flip our card to Red, at which point the waiters finally stopped offering us the meat. At this point, there is no way anyone should possibly ever have any room left for any food, but we still went ahead and ordered some dessert, since you always have to end with some sweet. There is an extensive dessert menu (which is unfortunately not included in the $60 price, but fortunate since I would have had enough to really make myself sick if it were all included), from which we chose the Turtle Cheesecake ($11). I was once again surprised by how delicious this slice of cheesecake was, as it was one of the best I've tried, and it was an incredibly satisfying end to an overwhelmingly good meal.Once again, the service here is unmatched. The meat guys were so good, they quickly learned which temperature we liked our meats cooked to, and they even learned of our preferences for which meats we wanted (the sausage guy stopped coming to me after I rejected him a few times). The other staff members were also incredible, repeatedly checking on us to make sure we had everything, but not in an overbearing or interfering way. They even have those guys that come and clean the crumbs off the table, who moved like stealthy crumb-cleaning ninjas, and completed the job before I could even notice in some cases.At this price, and more especially at this quantity of food you will likely consume, this is definitely not an everyday restaurant, but for any special occasion or day where you feel like eating a ton of really good food, this place cannot be beat.",5.0,"May 8, 2019"
"I absolutely love this restaurant. The service is incredible, from the sect you walk in the door. The overall meal is also a really fun experience.

The tres leche dessert was also incredible.",5.0,"Jan 2, 2014"
"As primarily a pescatarian this was an adventure way off the normal path. It was time for a zag (as in zig) and if you are going to do it a Brazilian steakhouse and the 'gaucho' way of creating a meal is a pretty good detour and for some reason a bit of a tradition to ring in the new year. Looking to take it the full experience of what it was about and leaving the consequences of creating a massive slug of meat in my system for later.The dining experience does not offer a menu of choices, instead what you have is a fixed dining experience. First is the salad buffet which is really quite fabulous. Everything I had was very fresh and quite tasty. Hearts of palm, artichoke bottoms, massive asparagus that is surprisingly crisp yet completely free of stringiness, and much more. It may have only been the starter yet it could have easily been the meal in itself -- not because of it being a bottomless buffet but rather because I found the quality and range of taste that good.When you finish your salad a waiter quickly comes by to swap out your dirty plate for a clean one and then it is up to you to turn your service chip from red to green. Upon doing so what could be described as a swarm of waiters with various cuts of meat start stopping at your table to allow you to select different wellness pieces of their offerings. Everything is carried about on swords where either the pieces of meat are deskewered (in the case of something like the sausages or pork chops) or sliced into your personal tongs.The problem I have here is separating all of the styles that came so fast to understand what I liked the best -- a far easier task on this third visit to Fogo!!! There were a few that did indeed stand out but if you are coming for a visit there is no reason not to try all that is offered to find your on personal favorites. And there is also not a problem turning something away if you want to skip it (like I did with the chicken offerings that came around) or requesting something that did not seem to be making it to your table on its own (like what happened to us with the leg of lamb). There are also sides of warm cheese bread, polenta, garlic mashed potatoes (that are incredibly light), and caramelized bananas on the table that they do a great job of keeping refreshed -- though I had a hard time even remembering they were there as I focused in on tasting the meat!This review is largely the same as what I wrote for the location in Scottsdale and outside of the above I think there are two other things worth noting: The place has only been open about a week and it was showing a few signs of bugs being worked out of the system including an error in our bill and a pretty crazy wait to get it fixed. However, Anderson (maybe the manager?) helped us out personally without a fuss and we will be back to try it again. Also, from the perspective of the Brazilian experience in general we have also tried Churrascaria Plataforma here in NYC, Espetus Churrascaria in San Francisco, and Texas de Brazil in Las Vegas and to date hold Fogo de Chao on top.",4.0,"Mar 1, 2018"
"I've been wanting to give this place a try finally got a chance during restaurant week. I arrived a bit early to my rsvp so I waited by the bar since I still had to wait for my friend..  drinks, I tried the Fogo premium Caipirinha whoa got me by surprised strong taste, great drink my choice for the night. Once seated we got our special menu & started with the market fresh salad bar plenty of options here but Keeping in mind all the meat to come.. I got some Salad not bad tried some of the potato & chicken salad good & some fresh mozzarella which was great. For the table u get some appetizers Cheese bread was delicious good Polenta & Sweet plantains help balance the meat tasting. On the meats Pork chop was great nice taste, good Chicken & Sausage. On the steaks decent Sirloin best for me was the Garlic steak very tasty. For dessert good Key lime pie & chocolate mousse cake. As for the restaurant nice bar & waiting area upstairs with plenty of seating below. Nice decor service was good, staff is very attentive price wise since it was restaurant week hard to go wrong I left in quite the food coma so much meat it's insane.Glad I gave this place a try a lot of food but it was enjoyable.",5.0,"Sep 22, 2021"

"Mm mm mmm! I have been here for both the regular menu and restaurant week menu and both times I throughly enjoyed everything! I think the only thing you don't get to try on the restaurant week menu is the filet mignon which was delicious but don't worry, there's plenty of other meat that's just as good. I can't even rank the meats, they are all so perfect, you can get it how you like. I personally don't like the pork or chicken just because those meats tend to dry out over a open fire but people still enjoy them. But you can't go wrong, just get everything! Try it all, eat everything, you can regret when you get home.

"I came here about two months ago. My boyfriend and I are in love with Brazilian Rodizios but this (specifically for the price) was very sub par. Yeah yeah, I get it, we're in NYC but STILL. Way BETTER options out there at a fraction of the cost. The salad bar was only okay. I have been to ones cheaper that have provided a few more options. There were a lot of good tasting meats, however a lot could have used more seasoning. The drinks were good, I always get a coconut caipirinha and this was actually very good. BUT AGAIN, not worth the crazy NYC price. The service was also okay, nothing spectacular. I just wish that for the price we are paying, SOMETHING would have stood out. Buts it's just nothing special if you frequent Brazilian Steakhouses.",4.0,"Mar 5, 2014"

"Went to Fogo for a networking event.  It's a brazilian steakhouse, known as a churrascaria,  that is in fact a chain.  However, it is a chain that I can't believe that finally came to NYC. This location only opened recently, with the first location in the US opening in my hometown, Dallas, Texas, 15 years ago.  After visiting the Dallas location with my family, and later experiencing the not-so-good experience at another New York similar type restaurant Churrascaria Plataforma, it's about time Fogo de Chao arrived to New York.  While again only there for a networking event, their signature drink, the caipirinha (made primarily with a Brazilian pure rum called cachaça, pure sugar, and lime) is delicious.  Also had the opportunity to try the filet mignon, ribeye, shrimp, and various croquettes with catfish and cod.  All were absolutely decadent, especially the filet and ribeye.  Decor / ambience fits and is very modern yet sets the mood.  It's a large restaurant but not overly crowded nor too loud.  The bartenders were accommodating and specifically the bartender Emmanuel makes a great margarita.If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, here are your need-to-knows:-their specialty is red meat-for this location, $40 lunch, $60 dinner-you have a disc on your table, green means bring me food, red means stop bringing me food already! (you can always go back to green after you take a break) -they will keep bringing you various meats unto your hearts desire-your meal includes a salad bar, but no drinks, taxes, or gratuities - so keep that in mindThe meats at Fogo are so flavorful - trust me, you will leave so full you won't know what to do with yourself.  Come hungry. I hope to go myself soon for lunch or dinner rather than a networking event, and will update my review once I do.",4.0,"Mar 6, 2018"
"Came during restaurant week and I would only come during restaurant week. Salad bar I would prefer Churrascaria. However I like the meat here better and there is more meat selection. The seasoning is better and I love their house steak. I had to get that more than 3 times! Just had to even when I was full. I like their cheese bread more too. The place looks a lot more elegant, however we were seated near the corner where people were coming in and out of a back door? So that wasn't very pleasant, and we were easy to miss so there were a lot of times that I wasn't able to get what I wanted. I would definitely come back here again though.",4.0,"May 3, 2018"

The artichoke dip my friend and I devoured was absolutely delicious! The bar overlooks the large dinning hall and from what I could see, the food looked pretty tasty.  The bartender was personable and meticulous with her drink making. Prices were as expected. I'd come back for a drink before or after the MOMA, and perhaps for dinner with a date who wants to check it out.",4.0,"Aug 3, 2018"

"Fogo is a decent place to have a get together with a bunch of friends or simply a night out with family. However, I've definitely had better Brazilian steakhouse experiences elsewhere. We were a party of 8 and we were seated promptly. We made reservations via opentable. It was quick and easy. The service was not superb, but it wasn't terrible either. It did take forever to get our drinks and bill. Also they didn't serve the sides immediately. They brought over the polenta fries and fried bananas a little late. They were also very stingy. They gave us tiny tiny platters of it; only enough for 1/person. The options were also lacking compared to others. Plataforma, a few blocks away, served yuca fries and other stuff as well. The salad bar was smaller than expectation. Most places have sushi and more seafood. This place had smoke salmon, cold cuts, rice, soup and a lot vegetable options. The cheese bread was good though. Might've been my favorite for the night. The guava alcoholic drink was delicious. It's a seasonal drink so it might not be available besides spring. A lot of the meat selection was dry, especially the chicken and pork tenderloin. The filet was pretty good, but it came towards to end of the night and I was already full from the dry meats. You have to ask for medium rare or else they'll give you the dry ends. Instead of waiting for them to come around with different meat, I suggest asking them for the specific cut you want. Overall, this restaurant is only meh but I still had a good time. If you're eyeing the Yelp cash back and you're not very picky about food then come here. If you want good steak, don't expect it here. It's only mediocre, especially for the price. We ended up spending over $700 for a party of 8.",3.0,"Mar 17, 2018"

"Deeply disappointed in my latest trip to Fogo de Chao for Winter Restaurant Week 2018. I always put in the time and make the trip back at least once a year. After all, who can resist all you can eat meat?You don't get the super prime cuts when you do restaurant week, which makes sense ($42 vs $63 base). It's still a good deal but I regretted making the return trip this time. I cut the bacon wrapped chicken in half and to my horror - I saw that it was still raw inside. So raw that I could still hear it clucking. It is completely unacceptable that the chicken was raw - what if I had eaten it and gotten sick? I looked over to my friends and I immediately warned him that mine was raw. And his was raw too! We flagged someone down and our waiter seemed confused by what we were saying. Eventually, he understood and had someone take it off our plates. They offered to bring us new ones as they took it away but I immediately refused. It had already ruined the experience. I can appreciate rare steak but definitely not raw chicken. That was the end of it and we weren't even given a complimentary drink or a choice of a prime meat for the raw chicken fiasco. In addition, steaks were also salty and was never served the right temperature (I just wanted medium rare, is that so hard?)Service was pretty poor during the night too. It was finally time for dessert and had a choice between NY cheesecake, key lime pie and chocolate mousse cake. We were given the smallest slivers of dessert (really different from all the prior years). The only reason that this is two stars and not one star is because of all of my prior good experience. I would say it is bittersweet that I'm never returning to Fogo but I'll just think about the raw chicken and I'll get over it. TLDR served raw chicken, bad service and not returning.",2.0,"Feb 7, 2018"
This was my first time into Fogo de Chão New York City. We had a great experience! It was my son's birthday and Benjamin Maddy was so nice and accommodating to us. Super helpful. He let us know of all his favorites on the menu and let us know of all the special events this restaurant can handle.  Our meal was great and the candle on the birthday dessert made our dining experience even more special. Thank you Ben! Cheers!,5.0,"Nov 13, 2021"
"Nothing short of delicious. Super attentive staff, never had to wait, and if they didn't have the meat cooked the way we liked, they made sure to stop by as soon as another batch was prepared. Could be happy and full from just their ""salad bar"" with all of the amazing foods they offer!",5.0,"Nov 13, 2018"
"I knew it was going to be a good night when I found parking right across the street from the restaurant.  With the reservation there was no waiting to be seated. While in the upstairs lobby you can smell the freshly roasted meats and poultry. It was impressive to see the cavernous dining room below form the lobby, kind of surreal. The cold bar was stacked with beautifully prepared vegetables and salads including sausages and cheeses, that's all well and good but I came for the meats.  They did not disappoint, different cuts of beef, pork, lamb, and chicken came in waves to the table. All items were fresh off the grill.  Sitting close to kitchen is always my first choice of seating, but this time it worked out.  As they came out of the kitchen they usually stopped at my table and I had first cut of the goods.I ate until stuffed, great staff, beautiful restaurant, a good time was had by all",4.0,"Feb 24, 2019"
"The Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse is a beautiful location and facilities across from MOMA.  We ate outside and had a nice time.  The food was great if you love meat, the place to go, but that is what Brazilian food is about.My only complaint was our server, Laura, took our order, and we never saw her again even after asking others to tell her we needed service.   It took forever to get our two burgers, which were quite good, and fortunately there were other waitstaff that we were able to catch their eye to fill the water glasses, order desert and give us the check.  I still left a 20% tip. Totally unacceptable at their prices.  Was that we were a mixed race couple a factor.  I hope not.",4.0,"Nov 9, 2020"

"I went to Fogo de Chao last Monday for their restaurant week dinner deal. The service you are provided is top notch. The staff makes an effort to explain to you how the system works and they are attentive in regards to making sure you're getting all the meat you want. I'm pretty impressed  by the amount of items available at the salad bar. There is a great variety of fruit, cheeses, veggies and cold cuts to keep you satisfied. Now, the grand finale is the unlimited supply of meats that the gentleman walk around with and offer you (if you flip your card to the green side). I really loved the strip steak and thought it had amazing flavor but honestly all the meats were delicious. I'd pass on the chicken though because we eat chicken all the time in our every day lives so definitely just stick to the beef or lamb here. Overall I had a great experience and realized that eating meat fills you up so fast. For $42 at restaurant week pricing, this meal was priced great. If I were to pay $60+ at regular pricing, I still think Fogo de Chao is worth the price. Obviously not for every night but for big group get togethers this is a solid restaurant and there is something for everyone, even the picky eaters.",4.0,"Feb 2, 2018"

I'll let enterprising readers go find my review of a different location, but in summary, I'm a fan of Fogo's USDA choice meat offered at a reasonable price, though I find that from both a value and overall quality perspective, it pays to target the filet and picanha sirloin, and maybe ocassionally dipping into the lamb and [gasp] perhaps even the ribeye.  Okay, I kid, it's way more fun to get a little of everything, even the obviously higher-margin-for-Fogo-the-public-company cuts.",4.0,"Sep 10, 2016"

They also have an elevator.We started off with salad bar which was not very good just fruits, veggies and some bread. At the table they brought out this delicious bread and polenta and plantains and the best mashed potatoes. All very good, then came the meat. Lamb chops were the bomb, they also had various steaks, chicken, sausage and other cuts of lamb. Personally, I love meat but it was a little too much for me.

"Came here for an anniversary with my boyfriend. Had a bunch of different kinds of meats. I like the idea of the red and green coasters that were used to alert the waiters if we wanted more meat or not. There was a bunch of different meats, the ones that stood out was the chicken and the filet mignon. It was juicy and delicious. We also tried the lamb, the pork, the sausage, the bacon covered beef and bacon covered chicken. Everything was really good and the quality of the meat was definitely up there. I like how they made sure that the sides were always available to us and they kept it coming. The salad bar was a pretty cool way to start our meal. The creme brûlée was amaazzzzzzing and the waiter was nice enough to give it to us on the house. We also had key lime pie and that was good too. We didn't expect to spend so much but it was definitely an experience. Would come back to try again!",4.0,"Dec 3, 2017"

I also appreciated the plantains and other small plate that they placed on the table. I noticed that this place is perfect for large groups.

"Never been to a Brazilian steak house like this before but it was an interesting experience. I came here for my boyfriend's birthday (super huge meat eater) with his family. It's located in midtown near Rockefeller Center so driving is NOT recommended unless you want to pay an arm and a leg for parking. Its an elaborately spaced restaurant with an modern entrance and staircase to the main level of seating. There's a private room for parties or large groups and the bathrooms are pretty immaculate. The concept: Each person is given a token with a green and red side. The green side means you would like to be served and the red means you don't need anything. Wait staff will be floating around the room with a variety of selected meats including chicken, beef, and pork. As they circle the tables they will provide meat to anyone with a token on the green side. There's a flat rate for this type of ""meal"" that includes some sides like potatoes and access to the salad bar. The salad bar isn't just salad but a selection of fruits, vegetables (roasted, cooked, and raw), cheese, craved deli meats, nuts, lettuce-based salads, and other types of salads (quinoa, green bean, etc.) Altogether the experience is a bit overwhelming especially for someone like me that isn't a huge meat lover/eater. However, it was nice to have a dinner and a show! Also the meat was deliciously tender (most of the varieties) and the salad bar was so filling. Definitely a spot for a celebration (i.e. birthdays, anniversaries, etc.), fancy date night, and experiential eating.",4.0,"Jan 28, 2018"
"We've enjoyed eating at other Fogo de Chão locations in the past and were excited for an equally satisfying experience on 12/3/17. You need to show up with an appetite, the men with the meat come by your table quicker than you can eat. But that's the only thing that's quick. We waited a lot during our meal...for the drinks, the wine, the cheese balls...the bill. We wanted to order more wine and even dessert, but we sat there with empty plates and wine glasses so often that when we had a chance to finally request the bill, we took it!One gentleman (a manager perhaps?) stopped by our table and asked how our meal was. We told him we enjoyed the dinner and were done eating and mentioned that we would like to see the dessert menu. He said he would have our table cleared and that he would also have someone show us the dessert menu. Neither happened and after waiting for some time, one young lady asked if we needed anything else and we jumped on this opportunity to ask for the bill. They actually chose not to make more money off of us by not being more attentive. Odd huh?  Oh well. The meats that were brought to the table were pretty tasty (the chicken was my favorite), the potato salad was good, salad bar was okay, the rice was bland, and the feijoada was mostly just beans with very little pork in it (I recommend adding the farofa seasoning on top, it kinda needs it).Lastly, the little bowl with the pao de queijo (Brazilian cheese balls) were tiny and dry. The first bowl had four of these tiny balls in it and the second bowl that was brought to our table only had three. So the two of us split the last one. Now, you see a table with an even number of people and you bring out an odd number of these dry little balls? The fried bananas however, were pretty good. Eat some of those. Oh...almost forgot. Try and avoid sitting by the end of the staircase that leads down to the dining area. Specifically where the hosts stand and meet customers coming down those stairs. That's where we sat and the hostesses all kept leaning on the empty chairs at our table while we ate.",2.0,"Dec 4, 2017"

Wine bottles everywhere and very elegant. *super fancy* came here for a birthday party for my boyfriend. Reservations are encouraged. The salad bar here is phenomenal but is also a trap. do not eat the salads. Just get the meat!!! There were many different types and cuts of meat offered. My favorite was probably the beef ribs. Super tender and moist. This was my first time at a place like this so I didn't know what to expect but it was easy to catch on. I would probably come here on restaurant week to get my money's worth cuz it's literally impossible to eat that much meat.Also, their ""dessert menu"" is basically a tray of desserts that you can choose from.

"I'm so late in writing this review, as I experienced Fogo via the Manhattan Yelp Elite event that happened...a century or so ago. Please excuse the lateness. It was kindly meant (ha!). Anyway, Elite events are always different because businesses tend to pull out all the stops. In this regard, Fogo gets an A-infinity-pus for effort. All cuts of meat were mindbogglingly delicious, the appetizers were well-cooked and tasty without being too rich. Only the service left a bit to be desired, but I suppose some of that might have stemmed from simply serving such a large, private party.",5.0,"Sep 27, 2015"
"WOW. Now I definitely see what everyone raves about. My friend told me that she took her boyfriend for his birthday. So I did the same and took our daughter as well. She did warn me that its a bit on the pricier side (I'm on a college kid budget and I have a daughter too lol). But while trying to make the reservations I noticed that they had a special price on lunch (12-3) on Sunday's (40$) for full buffet. PLUS they emailed me a coupon for the fall that saved me almost 30$. That really helped. I cannot imagine how much without those things. Ok enuff about price lets get to grubbin!Although I read up on the place prior to going, the waiter was kind enough to explain how it works because we were first timers. It looks like a coaster for cups; one side red for no meat and one side green for meat. We went to the salad bar which was broad in variation and yummy. After snacking a bit, we went to business and flipped to green bc we were ready for the goodness. They weren't kidding about fast and attentive service. Within 5-10 minutes, we had to flip it back to red bc we got a bit overwhelmed. The waiters were considerate to ask how you like the meat, which was medium well. They complimented the meats with the sides of mashed potatoes, something called pourri? it looks like fried yucca with parmesan cheese and sweet plantains. The waitress always made sure we were satisfied, always filled our water and even sweetly made conversation with my daughter. After we were painfully full we still forced some room for desert. The staff brings over a plate of samplings of the cakes/pies/sorbet that is offered. The young lady gave me a recommendation of mousse which was AMAZING. They even sang and decorated my boyfriend's plate for his birthday.BOTTOM LINE: To skip my essay haha, This might be on the pricier side but its well worth it. The staff is attentive, sweet and speedy. The food is pretty much unlimited. You will never know what being full is until you come here. But thats just my personal experience.",3.0,"Aug 1, 2016"

Was going to ask for it again but at that point I told myself forget it...Overall..the food was just okay...I don't know whether it's worth trying this place one more time.",5.0,"Nov 23, 2021"
"Dim long-ago memories of a unique experience prompt me to re-visit Fogo de Chao, an upscale Brazilian Steakhouse restaurant located in New York's Midtown Manhattan. It's just a short walk from Radio City, MoMA, and plenfy of corporate offices. This prime location makes it the optimal spot for tourists, locals, or dignitaries. The space is fully indoor except the warm summer months when four to five outdoor tables are available. During the covid pandemic, the restaurant adapted to a new reality, offering takeout and delivery options.A reservation is just a phone call away. A pleasant lady who immediately books me a table for two people on a fairly busy Wednesday night. From the outside looking in, the atmosphere is inviting. The second we arrive, the hostess welcomes and escorts us to our table downstairs. The striking three-level restaurant has a stairway with glass railings leading to the bottom dining level. The yellow-brown atmosphere is light and airy due to high ceilings and tables with generous space between each other. The installation of dim lights, which tend to encourage customers to eat at a slower pace and feel more content with their dining experience, is an excellent choice for an upscale all-you-can-eat churrascaria.Fogo offers a traditional Churrasco experience for $71.95, including continuous tableside service of signature fire-roasted meat cuts, market table, and feijoada bar. You can also select the market table with a feijoada bar for only $34.95. It is a no-brainer for my partner and me to choose complete immersion into the best experience. The staff is excellent. As the hostess leaves our table, our waiter for the evening introduces himself, offering us a drink and wine list. He quickly explains the concept of churrascaria all-you-can-eat dining.Unlike in buffets, we don't have to serve ourselves. Instead, we receive a card that is green on one side and red card on the flipside, when we want to tell them to stop bringing the meat. Within the wink of an eye, the back-waiter places side dishes on our table. As an appetizer, I walk to explore the salad bar. The marble-topped buffet table is bending over the filled-up bowls of salads, cheeses, meat cuts, and an endless selection of dips and dressings. People observing vegetarian diets can quickly satisfy their bellies too. I'm fighting with the inner voice that pushes me to taste a piece of everything. I know my stomach's limits that I am safe for the best that is yet to come.I sit down at the table at which the waiter is opening the bottle of red wine. After the first sip, my partner and I both flip our cards to green side to launches the festivities. Waiters with racks of meat on skewers as long as swords start turning around our table. Hot off the grill, juices are racing under the knife slice from the different cuts of meat offered. A fillet mignon blackened all along the perimeter, a fraldinha bronzed to perfection, a smokey costela, and a frango- the chicken breast trussed in bacon are all part of diversity that is the ultimate mission. I rinse my a palate between each piece with a mild, perfectly paired red wine recommended by the sommelier.The selections are unbeatable. I've had decent dining experiences with a lot of variety, and still, Fogo manages to impress me. The taste of their filet mignon, which I specifically ask for twice, stays in my mind. The crispy polenta and warm pao de queijo, aka Brazilian cheese bread, are a must to try. It's unavoidable to enter the place hungry.Pricing is top-notch, considering the quality and freshness of food, the unique dining experience, an excellent and friendly staff, an elegant ambiance, and the restaurant's prime location. Fogo De Chao should be included on everybody's must-go-to list. Based on my experience, I unquestionably write it down on my ""must-return-back-to"" list.",5.0,"Jan 1, 2019"

"Came here for lunch today. When I entered, there is a bar and a host at street level. The restaurant is downstairs. The place is busy for a Wednesday.I saw that the salad bar has various cheese, vegetables, salads, appetizers, fruits, one entree, soup, and rice, compared to Plataforma. The servers come often with different cuts of meat.After getting food from the salad bar, I then got water, cheese bread, polenta, fried banana, and mash potato. The yucatán flour and the vinaigrette is at the salad bar, which I didn't take as the food itself is already marinated. Some cuts of meat is over-flavored; the garlic sirloin was strong in garlic that when I ate the fat, there was garlic flavor, and the ribs were strong in salt that they use coarse salt. There is a wine cellar between the basement and the bar. There is an elevator next to the restroom.",4.0,"Dec 15, 2015"
"Courteous and extremely attentive service.  Been there a few times now, and have never had a bad service moment.Well seasoned meats, and more importantly, not overcooked to well-done like way too many of the other rodizio places I've dined in.The salad bar is very nice, but don't overdo it.  Simple side dishes are also included, and the fried polenta is killer good when they're doing it up right--crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside.Very nice atmosphere with high ceilings that allow the noise from all the diners to go up instead of across to your table.  This is important, because this is not a romantic date night place to be, but it is a great place for small or larger groups.  You eat, you drink, you have fun.  It should be a lot louder than it actually is.Limited dessert selection, but after all that meat you really don't need it.Don't see a server with the type of meat you're looking for?  Ask your table captain or another server.  They'll make certain that those tender lamb chops come your way.The by-the-glass wine menu is heavy on the South American wines, but it makes sense.  There are also plenty of affordable bottles and a small half-bottle selection.Love the bar upstairs, but the street-level bar will do if you've a short wait for your table.This is my go to place if I'm arranging a night out for a group in the city.  As long as there are no vegetarians in your mob, then everyone will be sure to have a great time.",5.0,"Dec 14, 2015"
"I went with a group of friends, and I almost had to be rolled out when I was done.    It had been awhile since I've gone to a rodizio type place, so I was really looking forward to going.  I was also nervous since my last experience with rodizio (Seabra's in Perth Amboy) left a memory of over cooked meats.  We arrived at 5:30 with a reservation.  They were not quite ready for us, so we headed to the bar for drinks--capirinhas all around.  The bartender seemed a bit slow getting them to us, but he didn't shirk on the booze and they tasted mighty fine.  Even though we'd already ordered our drinks, the hostess also seemed a little anxious to get us to our table once it was ready and came to remind us that they were ready for us twice within a couple of minutes.  Once we had drinks in hand, we descended to the main dining area (which was very nice) and our seats.After that, it was all about the eating.  The salad bar was very nice.  I initially didn't want to waste any space, but I couldn't help but have some smoked (kippered?) salmon and an arugula salad. After that, the green light came on for meat.  I needn't have worried about overcooked meats.  If I wanted rare, they had rare.  Every cut or type of meat I tried was nicely cooked, and they were all tasty.  I was especially fond of the Fogo steak.  The sides were alright too.  Nothing crazy, but I used the polenta sticks to sop up the juices on my plates.The service was great.  There's an army of guys working the place.  They were all very attentive and helpful.  There were a couple of times when they got a little pushy when it came to ordering wine (they were gently, yet persistently encouraging me to hurry the heck up and order when I really wasn't ready), but other than that it was all good.I was absolutely full of dinner when they brought the dessert and after-dinner drinks carts around, but the key lime pie looked too good to resist.  It could have had a little more lime flavor, but it was still good and I had to get help to finish it off.It's not an inexpensive place to eat (as ever, the driinks will double your bill) but the food was good, the service was good, and I probably won't need to eat again for a couple of weeks.",4.0,"Jan 31, 2014"

"If their Los Angeles location is the poster child, then this 18 month Manhattan branch is the ugly sibling.  First the positives: the food is delicious.  Everything from the sirloin, bacon wrapped chicken, ribeye were cooked perfectly...though could use more selections.   The decor is also what you can expect from a high end Manhattan eatery.  Now, let me explain why I only gave three stars.  First the service though polite was neither attentive nor friendly.  Our waiter had a huge chip on his shoulder with a hint of attitude.  When a guest asks for water a half assed nod is not the same as a verbal reply of ""no problem"" with a smile.  The salad bar spread is no where as robust as the other well known Brazilian steakhouse.  And it annoys me to no end with their ""tourist trap"" tactic: almost immediately after we sat down, we were approached by a wait staff telling us about their most expensive drink happen to be their cheapest on Monday and some silly story about how it's made.  It was supposedly to be Pineapple Rum, but it was the best tasting 6 sips of pineapple juice $13 can buy.  C'mon guys, we spent over $125 per person you don't need to pull this kind of crap.",3.0,"Aug 19, 2015"

Once I got in there the ambiance was breath taking. This was a pretty big restaurant. Coat check was free which was a plus! We were then directed to our table which was on the lower level. From the time we sat down to the time we left, we had so many severs making sure that we were  okay and were  very attentive and friendly. When I looked at the restaurant week menu, I was confused because it was all meat. However, unlike other places I've been to, I was allowed to order from the daily menu and my husband was  able to choose from the restaurant week menu. Often times, places don't allow only one person from the party to partIcipate. When I looked at the menu, I honestly was a bit scared that the prices were going to be too much but they were decent. The part I loved the most about  this place besides the service was the self served buffet. There were so many options for all kind of eaters. The smoked  salmon was so good! Everything was very clean, fresh and presentable. As people were taking food, servers made sure that they were replenish anything that needed to be. My favorite appetizer however was the cheesy bread. They were so soft and tasty! I order the salmon and Asparagus and it was amazing. I loved my experience there and so did my husband.

We ended up spending 2.5 hours there.The steak quality was great, it wasn't as good as aged steaks from steakhouse, but you get to pick the cut.

"This is a nice place to go for a one time experience kind of thing and for people who really love meat lol (I guess that would be an understatement). The indoor decor of the restaurant is very nice. The restaurant could get a little loud due to large groups. There were so many different selections of meat that it was hard to remember which cuts we actually liked lol but most of them were good. Even the chicken breast wrapped in bacon surprisingly was juicy and tender. The lamp chops were great along with the various cuts of beef and steak. As for the seasoning, it's a hit or miss. I think they don't think they spread the seasoning very well. Some parts would be super salty while others don't have much flavor. So I can see why some people complained that it was way too salty. The service was excellent. they were very attentive in serving us the meat right when we flipped the card. They came at us every few seconds actually with a different kind of meat which is great ! We never felt like we had to wait around for them to get to us.The ""salad"" bar was great too ! It's not just a salad bar. They have lots of wide variety of things too duh as different cuts of cold cut Italian meats, cheeses, potato salad, greens, salmon lox, etc. They give complimentary birthday desserts which was great ! Anything from their dessert menu. We got the papaya cream with liquor dessert. Very unique and light ! Was it worth $65 bucks per person for this ? Only if you have a huge appetite for meat and can eat a lot. I wouldn't say the meats were MIND BLOWING amazing, but they were good and if you can eat your money's worth, then great ! But personally I don't think it would be worth it for me to go back again. It was a good experience tho !",4.0,"Jun 11, 2018"

"I wanted to love this place, as I'm a big fan of brazilian churrasco and has been to a lot in Brazil but I'm feeling so appalled and aggravated. It was going great in beginning, waiter -nice, girl waitress- nice, meat carriers came- nice/not bad but then when this certain meat carrier guy ( gentleman that was lacking hair) he was plain rude.  It was only this guy that would PURPOSELY not come to our table with the meat, and it was the only one we really wanted.  At first, he came by and went to the table behind us, and table to us..then ran away so we thought ""ok maybe he didnt see our green sign"" so we put the two green signs closer to side of table, and looked for him.. he came.. but didnt stop and just gave the meat to the table next to us again and left.  So this was the second time already, we kept an eye on him for the rest of the night just to see if he was doing it purposely or accidentally. He never came to us but only to the people around. Isnt this ridiculous?! After the 4th time, we flagged him down and he finally gave us the meat. But he never never came back afterwards even when we had our sign green the whole time.  Every other meat carrier came, asked and was nice but this guy even made eye contact with me and never came again. We kept looking at him the whole time to see if he was doing the same thing to other people that was same ethnicity as us.. and wow.  He did the same.  That's disgusting and stereotyping.  As a person with brazilian background but just dont look like it, I should've called him out on it.  Next time if I decide to go back but first I'll just warn everyone here. Positive thing, one guy who was carrying the meat and was all smiley the whole time. Tall, pale light skin WITH dark hair, we salute you.",3.0,"Oct 30, 2019"
"Came here for Restaurant Week and overall my experience was generally positive.The staff was warm and the service was above average.  They were relatively attentive and the stream of Brazilian meat offerings was steady from the moment you start eating.  However, I also ate a lot at two of the other big Brazilian steakhouses in Manhattan (Churraschuria Plataforma and Texas de Brazil).  Personally I still like those two options better than Fogo.  There are two main reasons for this.1. I wasn't a huge fan of the meat options.  Even though for restaurant week they didn't offer 5 types of meat from the usual menu, they still had plenty of good cuts to offer such as the signature top sirloin, flank steak, lamb etc.  The issue so much wasn't that the quality was bad, but rather the flavor was pretty inconsistent.  Some of the meat felt bland, while others were extremely salty (the latter being somewhat common in Brazilian steakhouses based on my own experiences).  There wasn't a cut that really stood out positively for me.2. The salad bar was disappointing.  One of the primary features of a good Brazilian steakhouse is the generous amount of options at the salad bar.  Based on eating at Plataforma, Texas de Brazil and even Chima (in Philly) - what was missing here was a real sense of variety.  There was no shrimp cocktail, no soup options, no sushi (which are all offered one way or another at the other Brazilian steakhouses that I went to), and even the smoked salmon tasted bland.  The proscuitto was also tough and unimpressive.  While the salad bar isn't meant to be a place to stuff your face if you're eating meat - compared to their rivals, Fogo definitely needs to work on their variety.It's a shame because the RW deal also included free dessert, which was good.  The chocolate mousse cake was nice, so was the key lime pie.  They also had a special pineapple infused caparinha which was solid.  Unfortunately the place only was average on the two areas that really counted in my book.I'll definitely go back to Brazilian steakhouses in the city .. but given what places like Plataforma and Texas de Brazil have to offer, I'll probably skip Fogo in the future.",3.0,"Jul 28, 2015"

"Wow I know that most people would really be impressed by this place and I've also been in the restaurant industry for many many years but ... first off the batt we were 3 adults one teenager and one child. When seated we were greeted promptly almost too promptly promptly in fact before I even had 1 or the 3 menus they gave us the waiter asked for our diner order twice. I had to look right at him and say "" we just sat down"" then after saying that to him he passed us off to a waiter WE flagged down just to get our drink order. Seems they don't have any problems serving a minor alcohol btw but we proceeded to the $80 buffet. The food was great and the meat selections were amazing as well. The real trouble was when we were presented the check. Now, standing over us the second waiter stood over us while ""paying the check"" on some type of iPad that he had to explain to us when he stood there telling how we can top over the suggested 20%. That was Rude and totally unprofessional// we won't go back",3.0,"Oct 10, 2021"

"I was dying to try this place because of the wonderful reviews here but honestly it didn't live up to my expectation. It think I may need to be a bigger meat lover to enjoy regardless, didn't live up to my expectation and didn't feel like it was worth the price.So as an FYI, this place has an option of all you can eat for $65. You're given a small plaque thing that is green on one side and red on the other side. Green lets the servers know you want more food and red means you dont want. The restaurant itself is beautiful and is hugeeee. The service is really good as there was always be someone coming to your table giving you more meat if you have the plaque on the green side. The meat was good but some of them were a little dry. I wouldn't recommend getting the chicken, it was a waste of space in your stomach and definitely could have been better. With all the meat options (i think there is 11?) you honestly start to forget what you're eating and what you have eaten. I don't even know if I tried all 11 of the meats. I can't even tell you which my favorite was because  there was honestly just too many! There is a huge salad bar that was pretty good but try not to stuff up on it because you're ultimately paying for the meat so don't waste your stomach for the salad bar. Overall the food was okay but I don't think i'll be returning till i gain a bigger appreciation for meat",4.0,"Jun 11, 2015"
"Design and service is a standout.  Food for the price, not so much.What beautiful architecture and design.  3 levels: you walk onto the check-in/lobby area, downstairs is dining, upstairs is an outstandingly gorgeous bar.  Glass, woods, metals, and robes.  Have to see to believe.A party of 7 had us feeling quite elite.  Wonderful check-in experience with a coat check and very professional handling.  We were then escorted downstairs to our table.  The place was packed.From the moment we were seated, lots of attention was had.  We ordered appetizers (kind of a waste, because this cost bookoo bucks and didn't eat it all), lots of drinks (both of the alcoholic and fruity kind), and of course, the AYCE (all you can eat) $65 per plate buffet.If you had the churrascaria experience before, the green/red wood block or sign means ""go"" / ""no go"" to I want MEAT.  The buffet, filled with hot goods and cold, was quite a thing of beauty with cheeses, salad items, and the standard items that include rice & black beans and caramelized bananas.I tried a lot of meats, and I can honestly say ""Eh"".  Maybe one was really good, the others were average.  Maybe I don't like meat much?  On the contrary.  The buffet is worthy, and available standalone for a lesser charge.Afterwards, our party went upstairs for a shot of whiskey.  $38 per glass, yikes.

"This is a great spot for after-work, group events.I was tasked to find a place that would hold 30-some-odd people for drinks and appetizers.  Fogo ended up being perfect.  The staff was courteous and friendly, the drinks were delicious, and we had an excellent experience.One of our very own was leaving for a new job after having spent 15 years at the company.  You make a lot of friends in 15 years and so we were looking for a place that could accommodate 30 of us after the in-house celebration.  A few places came to mind, but Fogo was our first choice.  It was close and it seemed classy yet accessible.  I called and spoke with their groups manager Debbie.  She was exceptionally helpful and offered to section off half of their upper floor for us.  I had a chance to speak to Debbie in person and I am happy to say that she was as delightful in person as she was on the phone.When we arrived, half of their upper floor had been sectioned off for us as promised.  Our bartender was quick to introduce himself, shake our hands, and start making us drinks.Everything went off without a hitch, everyone had a good time, and everyone left in great spirits.  I cannot speak to their food as I didn't have any, but if it's half as good as their service, then I'd say it's likely great.Seriously, do not hesitate to book a group event at Fogo; they're beyond accommodating and the decor is fabulous.",5.0,"Feb 25, 2019"
This place is great for the price! The meat/cheese salad bar is a great start but it can be very dangerous in filling you up fast. The way to go is to get the all meat experience for dinner.

"Stopped by for Restaurant Week lunch and was not disappointed. The salad bar was not the most impressive one that I have ever seen, but it had some solid options. Honestly, don't be that guy who goes to rodízio to focus on the salad. The rice and feijoada sides were pretty good and they tasted authentic. Make sure to smother them with farofa (toasted yucca flour). Their signature hot sauce was very flavorful. We made reservations for 3 pm, not knowing that it's when they close for lunch. I'd recommend coming earlier than that so you can sample more of the meats. We had lots and lots of picanha (top sirloin), which came often and it was delicious. The restaurant week menu supposedly includes 10 out of 14 or 17 meat options. You get the sides: pão de queijo (Brazilian cheese bread), mashed potatoes, some fried bananas (skip) and polenta. The service was very chill, but still very efficient and polite. Plates were cleared out often. Water glasses were refilled without having to ask. Our server politely stopped by, before they closed the grill for lunch, to see if we still wanted to have anything brought out. We were so stuffed by then, but luckily for us, there's always room for dessert. We shared the key lime pie and took the chocolate cake to go. Definitely a solid place. Most likely a lot more impressive at dinner time. Great place for groups. I think that they offer happy hour starting at 4 pm (aka Caipirinha time! lol). Make sure to make a reservation. I highly recommend wearing loose clothing and coming here prepared to eat a lot.",4.0,"Aug 10, 2017"

"Came for my anniversary dinner during restaurant week. It was our first time here. It was like casual with hint of elegance for the vibe. Our reservations were at 845 but we got there at 8 and was able to be seated immediately, which was beautiful. You go up to the buffet area where there are salads, fruits, this honey glazed bacon that was amazing; pretty much various sides. Then for restaurant week you had sides of mashed potatoes and 2 other items I can't remember and tried as much meat as possible. So many I couldn't even remember the names, unfortunately but most of them were good. More on the salty side for me but I think I'm a little more sensitive to salt than the average. It was a nice experience, so I would come again and be more intentional with my meat choosing. Everyone was friendly.

"Wow so after fighting a bout of food poisoning for several days after eating at another popular Brazilian steak house (cough cough churrascaria plataforma) I was .. turned off by the concept. I decided to try out Fogo since they were always emailing these amazing deals. The deal in particular was the Fogo Restaurant Month, $39.99 for some basic cuts of meats including the market table. What a deal! I ended up paying $50 per person including tip and tax for a party of 8. I celebrated my graduation here and making reservations was very easy, I used open table. The food itself was definitely better quality compared to Plataforma, although we weren't getting all the cuts of meat, there were still plenty of options. My favorites were the chicken, all of the sirloins and the bacon wrapped steak. Did I mention they also give you unlimited mash potatoes and cheesy bread slides? YES PLEASE. Also, I went over to the cold salad bar and discovered... sugar pepper bacon. What other restaurant serves that? I took a plateful and took it back to my table where it was devoured in seconds. The way you get your food at Fogo, is by flipping your card to either the red or green side. Then the meat cutters will descend upon your table and bless you with a generous portion. This is an AYCE so be prepared to loosen up your pants or just wear stretchy clothes. My server was amazing and kept refilling our waters, and our sides. Fogo definitely changed my mind about Brazilian steak houses and this will be the spot where I recommend all my friends.",5.0,"May 6, 2019"
"Yum!! Prices are higher in manhattan than when I had it in California. Lunch is $48? Or so. And dinner being 65+ each for all you can eat Brazilian BBQ. If you sign up for their email listing and give your birthday, they'll send you a $25 off to use which is rly generous amount. Also when you tell them it's your bday they'll throw in a decently large sized cheesecake size for the table to share!Overall I thought the garlic steak and ribeye were the best ! They also give table side dishes like mashed potatoes, plantains, and a bread-like roll (i forgot the real name!) my friend complained that a lot of their meats were super salty (might depend on what cut/slice Yu actually get). But it didn't rly bother me that much. I also noticed their meats are a little inconsistent when coming out of the kitchen.  Some round were def better than others!",4.0,"Jun 26, 2017"
This is one of those places for special occasions. The amount of food is way too much for every day eat plus its price. It is good for business accounts that want to impress. The large seating area is below as you descend down the staircase. We went during Restaurant Week which I think is a deal. It includes the food bar plus dessert. I think their motto here is to rush you with all the food and then they all disappear. So my advice is go slowly. Once you flip the card to show ready be prepared to say no and enjoy slowly. Of the meats I thought the pork was the best as it was the most tender and moist. I found the rest to be overly salty especially the ones wrapped in bacon. While usually anything in bacon is good this time it is a salt lick. Maybe we the inner slices are better.,4.0,"Nov 27, 2017"
"The food was amazing but customer service was so-so.  Friend and I walked in around 4pm. The hostess told us that there isn't any tables available but the bar was available and she also informed us that we can also order food there (at the bar).  We sat at the bar and ordered our capirinhas, and some food to go along with it.  5 minutes later, the same hostess told us that there's table available for us now.  We told her that we originally wanted to have dinner at the one of those tables downstairs, so if there's available table we will take it, however we already ordered food and drinks at the bar.  She then went on and telling us that we have to close out at the bar first and told us that we need to take this available table now or else someone else could walk in and take it.  She also told us that we can't cancel any food that we just ordered FEW (less than 5) ago.  We told her that we will take the table as soon as we close our tab at the bar.  The bartender walked out for a little bit and the hostess insisted that we head downstairs right at that moment.  We told her that we will wait for our tab, she kept telling us that we could lose the table.  so we told the bartender to bring the food that we ordered downstairs, we would just take it away.  The bartender said ok.  And we closed our tab.  We head downstairs and we still had to wait for 10 minutes to be seated. So we finally had a table, we enjoyed our Fogo de Chao experience.  After our dinner, we asked our server, what happened to the food that we ordered upstairs from the bar?  The server was unaware of it, and she took our orders again.  Keep in mind we already ordered and paid for these upstairs and we also just paid for almost $200 for dinner downstairs.  We sat there for another 30 minutes to waiting for our food to take away that we ordered almost 2 hours before.

"All hail restaurant week and restaurant week dinner pricing! For $42 you get food from their entire market table which is essentially a giant salad bar with salads, fruits, cheeses, and cured meats, as well as a great selection of their cooked meats (though a limited selection compared to their usual dinner menu). We tried every single kind of meat that was offered to us, but we got at least 4 servings of their house special sirloin, and top sirloin - all medium rare of course. The meats were all tender and juicy, some with a perfect crunch and slight bit of fat. The Parmesan pork was disappointing, but their lamb was to die for! Will I be back even if it's not restaurant week? Yes! Their cheese bread was my favorite non-meat food item.... I couldn't ravens 5 baskets of them had the server bothered to come back and re-fill my basket,My friend and I left quite full, and the reason for a 4 star instead of 5 is because I'm pretty sure their water gave the both of us stomach cramps.

"Two words: Overhyped and overpriced. I was not impressed by the flavors and variety of the meats nor was I impressed by the salad bar. Many of the meats were dry (namely the pork tenderloin and chicken) and it all tasted the same by the end of the meal. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish the pieces they gave me; I would take a bite of each thing and not want to finish it. I started asking for smaller pieces because of this. I didn't like how I kept getting end pieces too, which tend to be dry and tough. I don't remember a single meat to be memorable.. even their house special sirloin/picanha was just okay. The bottom cut sirloin was horrible. Chicken drumstick had a crispy skin but bland on the inside (very much needed a chimichurri or some other sauce). Pork chop and ribs - so dry. The Parmesan pork - omg I wanted to spit this out, it was so dry and tasteless. The bacon-wrapped filet mignon - truly very lackluster. My card stayed on green the entire time because I was still able to eat, but didn't want to eat anything they brought over... which honestly rarely happens for me at all-you-can-eat buffets. Now to the market table / salad bar, I was impressed by how many items they had and there was not a single thing I really wanted to put on my plate. I had really wanted a salad to go with all the meat but none of the salads looked appetizing. I stuck with the fruit (the papaya, pineapple, and dragonfruit were good). My husband liked the candied bacon. That might've been the highlight of our meal. I'm giving it two stars solely because all the wait staff were very friendly.

"For an idea that could very easily become a gimmick, Fogo de Chao does a decent job. Not perfect, but better than satisfactory.I met some friends for dinner at about 6:00 on a weekend. Some in the party were very late (their fault), but the restaurant was gracious in accommodating us.Churrascaria restaurants are known for their quantity of food, but I wasn't expecting the quality at Fogo. The full experience is expensive but worth it. The meat was cooked perfectly, though too salty (and I like salt). As many reviews have stated, the buffet is way better than your average salad bar. Our waiter recommended the rice and beans, and I'm glad he did - I'd say the rice and beans were some of the best food I had that night. They were remarkably good.Aside from the salty meat (nbd), I have two quibbles with Fogo de Chao. One is their beverage service. They had some South American take on a Manhattan that was not good. If ""South American"" means ""sweet like an Old Fashioned"", then fine. Otherwise, no. Also, I would have liked a digestif after all that meat. After checking with the bar, our waiter sheepishly told me all they had was limoncello. Again, no.Second is the bathroom space for a restaurant that big. I could find only one bathroom on the ground floor, with one urinal, and one toilet. When the ground floor easily sits 100-150 diners. One last time - no.But yes on the food. I'd come back to Fogo, absolutely if I wanted churrascaria, but even if I just wanted a good meal.",4.0,"May 13, 2019"
"This was my first time at this restaurant, but I've been to several Brazilian steakhouses at other locations. I am not a fan of midtown, but it was worth the trip since it was my dad's birthday. I was a little stressed and annoyed at first because we had reservations and to add an extra person to the table, we had to wait 35 mins more.After we were seated at our table, we were greeted by our waiter Cody. He was incredible. He went above and beyond to make things right. All the servers in his section were amazing. I can't say a single bad thing about the service. Normally if we don't like a restaurant we leave right after dinner, but the service was excellent and we ended u staying for dessert (even though we brought our own cake), cappuccinos and tea.  We were a very large party, but this is why I mention Cody- he was able to remember and accommodate everyone at the table. The other servers were excellent as well because of the fact that they remembered everyone's favorites. These are just some of the reasons why I loved this restaurant minus the waiting time at the beginning.",5.0,"Nov 3, 2019"
"Everything was amazing. I was introduced to this restaurant at a friend's birthday party when I had the full Churrasco experience. I knew I needed to return. Tonight I reunited with friends I haven't seen in person since the Covid pandemic began. We enjoyed wonderful outdoor seating. I was slightly disappointed the full Churrasco experience wasn't available for outdoor diners but my meal was so fantastic that I can't complain. One friend and I both ordered The Bone off the choose one Churrasco board and a strawberry cocktail. Both were great. My meat had a crunchy crust on one side that elevated it to maybe being the best beef I've ever had. Seriously life-changing meat. My other two friends each ordered the fillet mignon. We all shared the shrimp and lobster cocktail as an appetizer. Then we each ordered a different dessert and let each other taste ours. I had the Tres Leches cake. My other friends had the molten chocolate cake, the passionfruit mousse, and the chocolate brigadeiro. Service was also wonderful. Everyone gave the restaurant rave reviews and thanked me for introducing them to the restaurant. I give it 5 stars.",5.0,"May 23, 2021"

"I came here for restaurant week with my boyfriend and i was definitely impressed. Since it was restaurant week, they offered 10/16 meats from the usual menu (everything but the prime cuts). The salad bar offerings are diverse, the sides kept on coming and were delicious and dang - the steak:- MAKE SURE you try the top sirloin! Definitely my favorite cut. It was so tender and melted in your mouth- The flank steak was also noteworthy- Bottom sirloin wasn't as good as the top sirloin, but still delicious.- Bacon wrapped steak was a bit overcooked, but the flavors were good- Skip the bacon wrapped chicken!I had also called earlier to see if I would be able to order chicken hearts since it was restaurant week. They're usually not on the regular menu, but just ask for them! These were the highlight of the dinner - they were marinated well with a blend of spices. One order usually comes with 15-20 chicken hearts. And don't forget to ask for chimichurri sauce :) Would definitely be back!",4.0,"Feb 3, 2018"
Great experience for an all you can eat steakhouse. Servers keep coming around with food and long as you half of the sign that you want meat they keep on coming. I was there for the rest of the week and it was $42 for dinner that came with appetizers where you get an American Sable and there was a lot of food there like salami and all different types of imported cheese there was also a lot of fruits everything was very fresh. For dessert I got the New York cheesecake which was much better than I expected. For the meat of the hand some of the word but salty and the part was definitely dry but if you're going for the steak or sirloin or lamb it comes out perfect. Another thing is that the cheese bread is spectacular it's taste like an asiago bagel. I would definitely come here for a full-on experience if you want other types of meat to be part of the all you can eat Brazilian Steakhouse,5.0,"Nov 11, 2019"
fantastic service. everyone is very friendly.ambience is beautiful.the salad bar is amazing. there is so much variety. the bacon with honey and spices is to die for.my wife loves the cheese bread (unlimited!!!)the meat can get easily overwhelming. my suggestion would be to ask for smaller pieces and pace yourself.great selection of alcohol as well.,4.0,"Jan 31, 2018"
"This place is for the carnivores at heart, so please leave your veggie friends at home. It has beautiful décor inside. A nice staircase that goes down to the bottom floor. The restaurant appears spacious. All the meats were delicious and fresh. Seasoned well but just a hair salty. The cheese bread is my favorite! Always warm and chewy. The salad bar has a nice selection to look pretty on your plate, but you go here for the meats not the salads! Great service. I have been here several times, and the food and service is consistently wonderful. Right when it opens, it does take about 15 min before the meats start to appear and make rounds. I've also gone on my b-day and wasn't disappointed! It's a chain, but on par with others.",4.0,"Mar 10, 2015"
"If I can sum up my experience in one word, it would be delectable. This restaurant is deceiving from the outside, as it looks smaller from the street.  The moment I walked in, it was a like a SECRET CAVE in the hustle and bustle of midtown. This place was massive and BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED!ON TO THE FOOD:Salad bar/appetizer bar: UNLIMITED buffet bar of a variety of cheese, vegetables, rice, beans, and salad options.  My favorite was the smoked salmon. Sides: UNLIMITED SIDES of Pao de Queijo (Brazilian cheese bread), caramelized plantains, polenta and garlic mashed potatoes. These were refilled continuously throughout the meal, even without asking. We came back with our plates, and decided to flip our cards to green... and at that moment; we were surrounded by skewers of meat. I WAS IN HEAVEN.  Entrées: UNLIMITED MEAT (in order of my preference after a sampling of each)-Picanha (top sirloin with garlic): Being that this is the ""most popular cut"", I wanted to try pieces from different servers throughout my meal.  I was satisfied with every piece, with the meat prepared the same way each time. This was my favorite.-Alcatra (top sirloin): Extremely tender and well-seasoned with enough fat and meat proportions to keep it juicy.-Costela de Porco (pork ribs): Looked forward to these, seeing it being served at other tables. These ribs were very tender with a good balance between fat and meat, making it extra flavorful. However, it took about 45 minutes before these were offered to us. A server gave ribs to tables on both sides of ours, and skipped over our table even when I tried to call him over. -Fraldinha (bottom sirloin with sea salt): I had 2 pieces from 2 different batches. One was saltier than I preferred, but both were tender and flavorful. -Linguica (pork sausage): Well marinated and smelled delicious when the server came to our table. I noticed these were offered more frequently throughout the meal for every table.-Cordeiro (lamb): Very good, perfectly seasoned. -Lombo (pork loin filets): These were encrusted in parmesan cheese.  It may have been the batch we were offered, but it was more on the dry side. -Frango (chicken breast wrapped in bacon): I am a sucker for bacon. However, the chicken was a little dry and overwhelmed by the salty bacon.Dessert: Choice of cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake or key lime pie. We chose the cheesecake and key lime pie. Both were good, but not the highlight of our meals, plus we were extremely full to completely enjoy them! HahaFor the Restaurant Week price of $38 per person for dinner it was a steal (especially when dinner is normally about $60+ per person). The service is accommodating and very attentive when it came to flipping our cards from green to red, or vice versa. I highly recommend this restaurant for meat lovers!",5.0,"Aug 21, 2019"
"Came here for my birthday years ago. If you're a meat person, this is the perfect place for you. They provide you a circle card where one side is green for more delicious variety meats or the red side to pause your meat selections. Appetizers are buffet style so you can self serve yourself. Waiters walk around with different meats and cut you a piece of the meat! It's a great experience and I got so full!",5.0,"Feb 6, 2018"

"My boyfriend and I came here after we found out there was a Valentine's Day weekend deal, come that weekend and get a complimentary lunch or dinner coupon.We walked in and the ambiance was very nice and we were seated first at 2pm. Our server even offered to put a tablecloth over my white jacket to keep it from getting dirty! The salad bar was great and the waiters serving meat were very professional and followed. It is entirely very filling and afterwards you can see their desert menu before getting your check and getting cute mints and chocolates on the way out. The food was great and the service was great! If you are willing to spend the money, it's worth having a one-time experience with the unique serving style they have here!(Since its buffet try everything!

"I had an amazing experience from this place especially the huge variety of meats and salad bar options.  They also have a lot of options for the sides that come with the meals.  I like their concept of turning the card to let the meat servers know we were ready for more meat.  This gave us time to digest and eliminate them having to constantly ask if we wanted any meat. I have to give a big shout out to our amazing server, Zaida that day.  She was so attentive, checking in on us and letting us know all our side options.  She even noticed little details like my drink needing more ice.  This was definitely one of the best services I've ever gotten.",5.0,"Aug 8, 2019"
Meat paradise and a carnivores dream. The restaurant is 3 floors. The dining area is on the main floor with a large selection of salad bar options.

"I had a chance to try the West 53rd location on a recent visit to NYC. I have been to many locations across 4 different states and I have always had a good experience. But THIS location took it to a whole new level. Far and away the Best service I've ever experienced. On no less than 3 occasions, I began to request new drinks, particular meats, and new plates but, before I could finish my sentence, there was another server there with my exact request ready to go. It was as if they were reading my mind. This place truly rocked! What a great experience. And the place was by no means slow. It appeared to be as busy as covid restrictions would allow. But nevertheless, the Fogo team at this location just knocked it out of the park. I will be recommending this specific Fogo to all! Specific shout out to: Henry, Douglass, Jeff, and Zach. These guys are on their game! Cant say it enough - Absolutely Amazing Experience! Thanks to all!Cheers.",5.0,"Apr 28, 2021"
"Delicious Brazilian BBQ. I love coming here for the Lamb cuts especially the lamb sirloin. It's a delicious blend of perfectly charred outer and juicy medium rare center. The flank and chops are great too, although the chops are much too over seasoned. Just one thing to watch out for: we arrived well within the lunch window. Which ends at 1400 Surprise! And they tried to charge us the dinner rate... Sneaky, but we identified it and after a short discussion they corrected the error.",4.0,"Jun 24, 2018"
"First time here after reading all the great reviews and I was really impressed with everything! Walking in the place is beautiful with 3 levels, we were in the main area downstairs & my family/friends and I got seated right away with the reservation we had,the waitress was extremely friendly and informative, we all get started right away with the green cards up and out came the meats!I followed the tip of one of my fellow yelp elite members by getting small thin pieces so I could try everything and not get too stuffed!My favorites were at the chicken which was really delicious and succulent! And the garlic steak! Incredible juicy flavor!Everything else including the ribs, sausage and other cuts of beef very tasty as well but everything is just very salty,The salad bar which accompanies the dinner package is very good as well as the mashed potatoes,polenta and sweet bananas that accompany your meal,The drinks are outstanding and all and all it was a wonderful dining experience!I would definitely go to this place in moderation though if not you will be needing an angioplasty before you know it! LOL Definitely a little pricey but when you sign up for the email you get a $25 off coupon and other cool stuff! That was another tip I got from another yelp elite member of coarse! If you're in midtown or going to a show nearby this place is definitely worth a visit especially if you're with a large party just make sure you make reservations!

"Rules to abide by if you want to be smart about eating here:1. Pace yourself2. It's okay to say no to a meat offered3. You don't have to finish everything on your plate4. Ask for what you want5. Do not load up on the salad barI took my boyfriend here for his birthday during restaurant week. It was his first time, but my second time going to a Fogo restaurant so I knew what to expect. Unsurprisingly, he was in a food coma by the end of the meal.We opted for the full menu, but since we were seated in the midst of many RW diners, the waiters didn't start serving us the prime cuts (that were not on the RW menu) until we asked one of them about the other meats we were expecting. Wish they would have figured out earlier that we were not doing RW, but they made sure to check up on us after which was nice.I thought some meats were slightly overcooked. However, I did love the ribeye while my boyfriend favored the chicken wrapped in bacon.

"CHEESY BREAD!!!!If I could only use two words to describe my restaurant week dining experience here, those would be it. I can't describe how delicious they were, the addictive aroma and texture. Oh man, I could finish 4 pans of those in one setting. Also love their sides, the caramelized plantains and fried corn meals were unbeatable. And for the meat, make sure you get two portions (or more!) of the ribs and top prime. SO GOOD. Chicken wrapped in bacon is also super satisfying too, but it was a bit salty to my liking. For dessert we had cheesecake and key lime pie. Cheesecake I would have liked it more if it was not as sweet. 5 stars for their bread, selection of meats, and their superb service.

"I recently had dinner here on a Friday evening during Restaurant Week March 2015 and had an amazing experience.First off the restaurant itself is spacious and elegant enough that most types of dinner events could be held there easily. The restaurant quickly became crowded but getting a table for two wasn't very difficult as walk ins. Once you are seated your are given instructions on how things work. For one there are cards on the table that are use to request meat to your table or stop. Secondly, we were told that certain dishes were served to the table but salad could be retrieved from the buffet. I also found various types of rice dishes by the salad bar. The salad options were very fresh from what I observed.After we were seated with our salad choices we started with the meat by turning our table cards to green and almost immediately various servers showed up to our table with so many different cuts if meat. Most of the chicken options I was not really a fan of because I found them to be on the dry side. The best meat option in my opinion were the pork ribs - they were seasoned and grilled to perfection. Many of the beef cuts were delicious as well. We ate until we almost burst at the seams - literally. We also ordered a drink called the mango fresca that was a sweet girly tasting drink with a little kick which was perfect for me. I observed that this restaurant was definitely a favorite for guys and most of them did not waste time with a salad or anything green LOL. Dessert was also delicious - I chose the cheesecake while my friend had the chocolate mousse cake.I wanted to asked if doggy bag take homes were allowed but my friend insisted that I not ask. This was because she didn't want any attention to the doggy bags she was packing herself already LOL (She's going to kill me when she reads this!!)The staff was super friendly, helpful and attentive.

Great selections of vegetables and salad. My go to staple is garlic rice with black bean and salsa on top. So good. At your table they have Brazillian cheese bread, mash potatoes, sweet plantain banana and friend polenta.  You can ask for more if you finish your sides.  Once you're ready turn your sign to green and the all you can eat meat starts flowing in. Waiters would come by with meat on sticks. When you want them to stop you turn the sign to red to take a break.  Service was wonderful.

Why the 3 stars then? A couple reasons:1) Although they are slightly cheaper than Churrascaria Plataforma, the salad bar is not as extensive.2) My major issue really was the fact that we could not be seated until our entire party was there (even though everyone was ready to eat and tough luck for the latecomer)However, overall a good experience.

"I've been here before and I wasn't displeased. Is the salad bar as extensive as Churrascaria Plataforma? No. Are the meats better? No. Is the service as good? No. Is the dessert selection as good? No. However, all of that I could have overlooked and given a 3 star review. Except for my last visit.Now, I understand a restaurant's policy to only seat a party when everyone is there. If the place is crowded or it's busy, I absolutely understand. However, when the place is half empty and I'm told I can't be seated until my entire party arrives, even though the majority of us are present and ready to eat, I have a problem with that. Maybe they were hoping we would spend more money at the bar where we were waiting. Here's a tip: Churrascaria Plataforma seats you when you're ready to eat if they're not busy.

"As soon as you walk in you can't help but admire the decor. From the huge chandeliers to the long staircases and beautifully lit bar. The staff is extremely friendly. My waiter helped me take off my coat, which got awkward because it was hard to take off due to the many layers I had on, winters in NY are no laughing matter. But the waiter and I made light of the awkward moment and joked about it. It was my first time there so the waiter explained the process. We are given a coaster which has a green color on one side and red on the other. When the green faces up it lets the gaucho chefs, that are constantly circulating around serving, that you are ready for table side service. When you are satisfied you flip the coaster to red until you are ready for more.But first to the salad bar! I would have been satisfied with just eating at the salad bar.It had fresh cut vegetables, imported cheeses, cured meats and sushi. My favorite was the potato salad and the mango shrimp salad that I still think about from time to time. And I hate mixing savory with sweet but it worked this time.  I had to pace myself because I needed to make room for the feast ahead of me. The sides came which were crispy polenta, garlic mash potatoes and caramelized bananas. I tried them and wasn't impressed by any of them. The polenta was mediocre, mash potatoes tasted like the instant kind, and I don't like caramelized bananas in general. But that didn't matter much because I wasn't there for the sides. I was there for the MEAT!  I tried the rib eye, roasted pork, fillet mignon,  New York strip, sirloin, and chicken wrapped bacon. Everything tasted amazing except the chicken was too dry. At one point I forgot I left my coaster facing green and I just kept being bombarded with meat. I was so stuffed I had no room for dessert as usual. My friend used my weakness against me, cheesecake, and convinced me to order some even if I had to take it home. I'm glad I did. It was so good that I somehow made room to eat it.  For $60 you eat from the salad bar, unlimited sides and unlimited meat. Drinks and desserts are an additional price.",5.0,"Jan 7, 2015"

Considering I ate this meal in an upscale Midtown Manhattan restaurant for this astonishing price is something to marvel at.

Oh my their cheese balls that come free with the meals are soooo good that my friends and I always fight for them. Keep up the good work!",5.0,"Sep 2, 2020"
"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Upon being seated, nobody came by to take our drink orders or bring us our side dishes. I had to get up and approach a waiter to actually have him come over and take my drink order. After asking for the check, it took over 45 minutes for me to receive it (not an embellishment). The food was good, but service should come first and foremost which is why I'm giving the one-star rating. I could've had great food and a much better experience at a million other places. I've been to other locations in other cities and had a much better experience, but I'll never come back to this one again.",1.0,"Nov 26, 2016"
"My review will be based from a vegetarian's prospective(at a steakhouse...I know). I visited here with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his 25th birthday. I had booked the reservation 2 weeks in advance and called in to inquire on their outside cake policy and cutting fee to my surprise did not exist. A big plus in books! Upon arrival we were greeted immediately and waited 2 mins to be sat down. We were directed to go downstairs where we saw a clear top view of the dining room. Just as pictured and even better! It was my boyfriends first time experiencing a Brazilian steakhouse and he felt like a kid in heaven with endless meat options. Overall, our experience went well up until our waiter approached me stating they could not find the cake. In this moment, he ruined the susrpise. Nonetheless , well return soon.",4.0,"Mar 19, 2019"
"I have never been to a Brazilian steak house, but all you can eat with steak is right up my alley. Restaurant week was a perfect time to come try it out. Overall it was fantastic. The servers came around so quickly that pretty soon there was more on my plate than I was ready for. Each rack had different cuts so you could ask for it cooked any way and they would give you the slice you wanted. All the meat was very tasty. I was also a big fan of the salad bar, almost more so than the meats themselves. All different kinds of salads, with different fruits and vegetables and smoked salmon. There was also a soup of sorts but by that time I was too full to even try it. And of course it came with a dessert for restaurant week so if I wasn't full by then I was way stuffed by the time I left there I would definitely come back, even if it's not restaurant week, definitely get your money's worth here.",5.0,"Oct 11, 2017"

The salad bar foods were fresh and a lot of choice.The meat was very delicious, but some of them were not my cup of tea. I liked the sirloin and the sausage!!!also the chicken was soft and juicy!However, The bacon wrapped chicken was dry and chewy. The rib eye was little bit heavy for me. In the end, we had the key lime pie which was just ok!The service was attentive. Our glass and plates were never empty because they took care of us all the time.

"I'm sure this is a lovely restaurant during a normal day, but I am specifically writing a review for Thanksgiving Feast 2016.  This is what was advertised:Roaster Turkey Breast with Au JusHomemade Cranberry RelishBrazilian sausage and apple dressing Sweet potato casseroleDinner reservations were for 6:30 PM  in order to be able to enjoy an early supper. Arrived on time, ordered beverages,  and then come to discover ALL advertised Thanksgiving menu items were no longer available!  The restaurant had run out of Thanksgiving items ON THANKSGIVING!I find it unfathomable that a 4 Star restaurant could not foresee and plan for such an occasion. I inquired and was told ""we have 1100 person reservations on Thanksgiving.""  Again, bad planning. I'm sure I will be reminded why we would choose a Brazilian steakhouse for Thanksgiving, but we specifically chose this restaurant for the Yelp rating.   Thank you",1.0,"Nov 24, 2016"
"I am not sure how a pescavegan ends up writing a review for a mainly meat place, but here goes nothing. And yes I am obviously only able to comment on the fish and veggie options here. Let's just say this place is swanky and very spacious. This is a chain and they have restaurants all over the US. I'm glad I put on a nice dress and some heels or else I would feel like I was under dressed. We made a reservation for 7 people for a friend's birthday. This place can hold many big parties, so not a bad option for BIG GROUPS. It took a few minutes for them to get us to a table, but we didn't mind. There is a nice bar on the first floor and the bartender was very on par with service, even asking if I needed some nuts to munch on since I immediately ordered up a dirty martini. The eating occurs downstairs. We got a nice circular table very close to the salad buffet bar. Five out of us got the meat plate. It is a flat price for $59 and you can eat all the meat and salad bar to your heart's content. There are chips on the table (one side is red and the other side is green). You place the green chip up when you want meat. It is basically like dim sum (where they come around with meats on skewers) and you get what you want. My friends said there was filet mignon, flank steak, pork, lamb, etc. And everyone raved about the meat, so I guess it was pretty good. They also bring out sides of polenta fries, mashed potatoes and plantains. I got the AYCE salad bar option, it was $29. And for that kind of money, not sure it was worth it. Nothing was exceptionally special at the salad bar buffet. The roasted eggplant, grilled asparagus, salmon, and quinoa salad were some of the things I ate. They had a good selection of cheeses and cured meats, but I didn't partake. Desserts were pretty good. I shared a chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream. Sweet and oh so guilty. For a party of 7, our bill came to about $570 including gratuity. I probably won't be back here (cannot afford this kind of extravagance), but it was fun for the experience.",4.0,"Oct 6, 2014"
"Fogo de Chao is my absolute FAVORITE restaurant. All-you-can-eat high quality meat already sounds amazing. I came here with my boyfriend during restaurant week for $30 per person. There was an unlimited salad bar along with fruits, cheeses, soup, and more. We also were given the most delicious starter bread I've ever had. The bread literally melted in my mouth as I ate it, as if it was filled with something. I always randomly crave that bread all the time and wish I knew what exactly it was. There were so many different meats, like beef, filet mignon, chorizo, lamb chops, and more. Be careful when you have your your card flipped to green because the servers come by and slice up a piece for you quickly. I had everything in medium rare and it was all so juicy!",5.0,"Mar 13, 2019"

"For a place like Fogo de Chao where you could eat unlimited meat, I was surprised they participated in Restaurant Week. We went for dinner and paid about $38 per person. One of my friends had booked the reservation for us and all I remember him telling me was that because we were doing the RW dinner, we couldn't have filet mignon (plus other cuts which are completely lost on me at this point), but regardless, we had plenty of choices. My most favorite was the Picanha which is a prime cut of top sirlon - apparently very popular at Southern Brazil churrascarias. So juicy, tender and flavorful. I just kept getting it every time they came by the table. The staff was very nice, but sometimes it was hard to flag them down to refill our glasses. Mind you, this is a very large and loud restaurant which doesn't look it from the outside because the dining room is downstairs. I don't think they are quite equipped to handle the large volume of customers - or maybe it was because it was RW. Despite the hiccup with trying to get small plates of carmelized banana, refills on bread and water for the table, I'll be willing to come back again and pay full price for the meal. It was definitely worth it. *** Rule of thumb: Don't go crazy at the unlimited salad bar. DON'T. I learned my lesson the first time. Save your stomach for the meat!! ***",4.0,"Apr 1, 2015"

"maybe I'm just not a fan of brazilian rodizio, who knows.

I think the full price is somewhere around $68 for a dinner but that does not include drinks or dessert so a good round figure would be $100-$125 per person if you want to add those items. It is a great experience if you like meat although you can get salmon as well.

Service was excellent; servers are very attentive, and very polite. Food was great; all you can eat salad bar including white rice, black beans, and soup. The appetizer were these delicious little cheese breads, and while you eat they serve you a side of mashed potatoes, polenta fries, and sweet plantain. The meat selections were great, I tried all the ones that came by my table. Some steaks I liked better than others but that depends on your flavor.

The ribs was the best my opinion but I felt like they kept coming by with the meat that wasn't that popular and the better quality meat was coming out less. Got a free dessert for my brothers graduation and paid for the other dessert which was flan and chocolate molten cake. The cheesey bread is sooo delicious! And the polenta with Parmesan is delicious as well. The website shows seafood but I believe that was additional because I didn't see them come around with any fish.

"We had a great experience here as a big group for restaurant week. The restaurant week deal for $42 (which didn't include lamb chops and a couple of other premium cuts) was an excellent deal, and the fact that South American wines were 50% off (Wine Wednesdays) was a nice surprise. The ""market table"" buffet in and of itself can make a delicious and satisfying meal -- fresh salads, beautiful produce, cured meats, cheeses, fruit -- and the vegetarian at our table agreed.

Fine cuts of all different meats, chicken, 3-4 different cuts of beef, pork, etc. but I just can't keep up with the big boys. They serve endless amounts of whatever you want. I do however love their customer service, ambiance, and salad bar. Even if you're not a huge meat eater they offer an amazing variety of cheeses, salads, and toppings etc. along with some sides brought to your table.

Plus, you even have access to that amazing salad bar, filled with various veggies/salads, as well as meats.

"I've been prolonging this review for ages. I actually suggested coming here cuz of all the great reviews. We went there for lunch since there's no way I'd ever spend over $60pp on a buffet. Mass produced food is always going to be disappointing no matter what price point but I still had high expectations. I've been to the other Brazilian restaurant in midtown as well. I was contemplating just going with the salad bar even though L really wanted me to try the meat. Our waiter technically decided for me as he assumed we both wanted the full buffet after he asked us whether it was our first time...Yes it was, but that doesn't mean everyone wants the full buffet. 1 star off..We headed towards the salad bar. Grabbed some cucumber salad, mozzarella, manchego cheese, prosciutto, smoked salmon... Bacon... L was here for the meat so he didn't really bother with the salad bar. Our waiter brought us the complimentary cheese bread, mashed potatoes, polenta and caramelized bananas. I tried their cheese bread which probably was the best thing I ate during lunch. I didn't touch the other items. I know smoked salmon is supposed to be a lil salty, but it was way over seasoned for me. It wasn't thinly sliced either and it didn't taste very good. Everything from the salad bar was over-seasoned so I only had a little sample of what I brought. It needed some acid to cut all that salt. It all started to taste the same. The prosciutto was horrible, it was so thickly sliced. When have you ever had thick sliced prosciutto??? It was chewy. I couldn't swallow it so I had to spit it out. Prosciutto needs to be paper-thin! Salad bars should have fresh items to brighten the palate, but everything was so heavy and one note. Bacon was ok.. But once again, more salt. At this point I should've just looked for some plain lettuce to nibble on. Service was excellent, very attentive, they refilled our water glasses constantly. I think I drank over 7 glasses with all that salt in the food and I barely ate anything. If you're looking for a particular cut, they will gladly bring it out to you. I ate one piece of lamb chop and perhaps half a slice of steak and I was done. Salt overload. My stomach could not handle anything else. All I wanted was glass after glass of water. The lil food I ate actually made me so sick. At least the lamb chop wasn't overly salty, but the steak wasn't that good. I gave it to L. I don't recall which cut it was, but I can make a fantastic steak at home. Anyone can, it's pretty easy with the proper equipment. This is why I didn't care for the full buffet. L didn't eat as much as he normally could, he agreed that the food was overly salty, but it doesn't bother him as much as it does for me. I was hoping that he could consume more just to offset my lack of dining, but he didn't want to get sick. My meal mostly consisted of their free water, hopefully it was filtered since it didn't taste that bad. I can totally understand the price reductions or the cheaper menu options that they have right now after we dined at the restaurant. Seriously they need to stop over-seasoning everything. It's not healthy. Use fresh herbs. Different spices. Salt should not be the main ingredient. Maybe some lighter options at the salad bar. My stomach felt queasy the whole day/night. Not a great feeling while walking around Manhattan. About 6- 7 hours later, I was able to eat again and I couldn't believe how delicious a slice of pizza at My Pie tasted after consuming the worst meal I've had in my adult life. The owners at My Pie are committed to using quality ingredients.I'm not a fan of buffet restaurants in general, but it still bothers me even today how an $8 Chinese lunch buffet in Long Island is more enjoyable and didn't get me sick compared to Fogo's $40 churrasco experience. An experience I hope I never have to repeat. You'd have to pay me to eat there. I would never recommend Fogo de Chao, not to friends and definitely not to donors.Totally overrated. Salad bar was extremely disappointing. Not much of a selection. All the prepared salads are full of salt. The meat's kinda bland except for...the salt. High prices, huge restaurant in Midtown does not equal fresh, quality ingredients. It was fairly empty except for a couple of tables during lunch which is always a terrible sign. I just don't understand why this place is rated 4 stars.. 3 stars I could understand but not 4. It's not even that nice inside.Sadly I actually do have to come back and review them once more. Hopefully it'll be better for dinner than lunch. I'll update after my visit.",1.0,"Aug 23, 2016"

It's NOT like home style Brasilian cooking... with that soul, that flavour! And get this - the people that work there are NOT Brasilian either. Eu sou Brasileiros (I am Brasilian), and I know how Brasilian food is cooked and is suppose to taste. Maybe they mean Brasilian ""Inspired"" or ""Fusion,"" but the flavours remind me more like a Spanish American dish, the way Dominicans or Puerto Rican people cook Smh  Even where I'm working now washing dishes and prep cooking, I work closely with a BRASILIAN chef and BRASILIAN employees who know our culture's cooking - Fogo de Chão doesn't compare. However, I didn't wanna seem sour about not getting hired here, so I just figure I have extra dough in my pockets these days, and want to splurge - why not see what's the big deal here... And lo and behold! I Wasn't Missing Anything At All LMAO!  I ordered the braised beef rib slider, with caramelized onions, smoked provolone, on a brioche bun, trust me, wasn't anything special. Their feijoada wasn't that great neither. In case you don't know what ""feijoada"" is, it's a black bean stew, with sausage and beef, spices and herbs. I think the spices were there... but the stew was TOO damn soupy, and some the beans kinda mushy, so I don't know... Not how I usually make a black bean stew, unless I'm heading for a lukewarm tasting bean soup or chilli like Fogo de Chãos' nasty mess... Ewww. And what kills me most - it's a Brasilian Steakhouse... with no Brasilian cooks!? Whatsoever! Folks, don't waste your time or money here. Half that stuff they making there you can make at home with the right ingredients. Funny how NYC restaurant employers and staff are so busy trying play racist and favouritism amongst who they hire or serve (especially when you're a dark-skinned, Black/Latino man like myself), but none of these bitch asses know how to cook a good meal Smfh But we all know that old saying goes: 'when one door closes, another opens.' Lol I just won't be opening Fogo de Chãos' doors for anymore of that food to order or eat. And no, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone either. Three stars is good enough. I started to give two or one.",3.0,"Feb 28, 2019"

Came here for my birthday dinner and this place did not disappoint.  Many different types of meat just keep coming to your table until you say stop which is awesome! The salad bar was filled with fresh salad and cheeses.  Most reviews rave about the cheese bread which I did not have because I don't like cheese.  But everyone at my table couldn't get enough of it.  The only bad thing about the dinner was it felt like the same meats kept coming and I didn't get a chance to have rabbit.  Pricey restaurant but it's definitely worth it for meat eaters!,4.0,"Oct 19, 2016"

"Gorgeous atmosphere. Is it pretty spacious yet romantic?  5/5Was planning on going to Texas De Brazil but realized, it moved or went out of business, so my friends and I came here for restaurant week (you get all the same things but at a discounted rate - I believe it's about $15 cheaper - make your reservations in advance).  Things I liked. The beef, sirloin was my favorite along with the lamb. We kept asking for the edge pieces. Must get those charred edges. The cheesy bread upon arrival was pretty bomb.I've been to several Brazilian restaurants, and this one was underwhelming. Other places, had lobster bisque, grilled pineapple, and chicken hearts. The salad bar wasn't all that exciting, there were a lot of cheese options and cut up fruit. I'd come here for restaurant week but I don't know if I'd pay full price for Fogo. #noFomo",3.0,"Feb 7, 2017"
I came here for restaurant week. It's the best deal for restaurant week of all of the restaurants I think because you normally pay $66 a person and for restaurant week you pay $42. The only thing is you can't get filet minon and a few other special meats. However there is still a huge variety of meat you can try! They also have a decent sized salad bar with really delicious greens and fruits and cheeses to go with your meat. They also served mashed potatoes and sweet and fried plantains to the table. The waiters come by really quickly with skewers of juicy meat. The service was excellent. The food was delicious. It was a great dining experience and a really sweet spot for a special occasion!,5.0,"Jul 28, 2018"

"Awesome food. I love the steak and the variety of meat that they serve. The salad bar is also worth going back and forth for. Everything is fresh and you could tell that they were prepared very well and intricately. Giving this place 3/5 because as the service was fine, some of the servers kept bumping in my chair during dinner and was very unapologetic about it. For a place like this, I was expecting they would be more mindful about details in service as such. I would still back, anyway.",3.0,"Feb 11, 2017"
"If you are the type of person that identifies with the Louie CK quote ""The meal isn't over when I'm full. It's over when I hate myself."", then you will have the time of your life here. Luckily I fit squarely into this category so I was in heaven for 30 minutes before being relegated to food coma purgatory. This place reminds me of Bacchanal in Las Vegas, where you can have a similar experience.This place has an unnecessarily huge entrance which leads down to the main dining area. Kinda like the surrounding banks in Midtown with their imposing but empty lobbies designed to impress. It was like a metaphor for the sheer scale of the meats offered here.Y'all know the drill here. Flip the dual sided card green side up for more meat, and red if you want a break. The waiters were really good about bringing the meat promptly and filling up your plate, but seemed deaf to or were unsympathetic to my repeated pleas for ""medium-rare"". I kept getting the parts of the meat on the outside, which may suit some folks but to me is too burnt, well-done, and salty. Regardless, half the cuts I got were tender and tasted great.The restaurant week dinner special was $43 for 10/16 meats which was a pretty good deal to eat here. You'll be missing out on the filet mignon and lamb chops but there's still plenty of variety. They do go around more than once, in contrast to what one of the reviewers said below. It also comes with dessert so save some room in yo stomach for that.",4.0,"Jan 30, 2017"

"Beautiful restaurant especially love the light fixture hanging above the salad bar.Service was prompt; hostess and servers were friendly. Food - they give a few starters for your table which includes cheese bread (super light and fluffy with a hint of cheese in the lining. Taste reminded me of a cream puff/ pop over. But it's definitely worth the taste!), yucca fries, mash potatoes and fried plantains. The salad bar was small in selection but each item was super fresh. Highlights were the smoked salmon, mushrooms, quinoa, pickled red tiny peppers, baby lettuce and more. The meats were well seasoned but some were too seasoned. I especially like the lamb cut and the sirloin steaks. The meats kept coming so it was hard to keep tab of what is what but when they said house special, it was truly special.Dessert was disappointing! Chocolate mousse cake tastes like plastic. Key lime cake was bleh. I never went to a Brazilian steakhouse before so the whole experience was very unique indeed! But the standard price is expensive so restaurant week is worth it!",4.0,"Mar 4, 2015"

"Delicious!midtown location, my friends made reservations for a big table (about 16) this June Saturday, and we were seated together right away.Interior is elegant, ambience comfortable.I liked the salad / starter bar a lot, as although it wasn't huge, the selection was nice, and layout was pleasingZ  Highlights were the watermelon and cheese salad, and the wheel of parmagiano.Table bread was hot cheesy goodness!The meat was delicious!  Service pace was perfect for me, and I wasn't able to (nor did I plan to) try every piece of meat available.  My favorite was easily the lamb (chops and another cut), but every piece of meat was tasty.Perfect place to bring people.",4.0,"Jun 17, 2017"
The quality of the meat served    is really good but the service is so slow and people working there are really rude (not all of them btw ). Some   servers will pass  your table like they are going to take the train during rush hour. You need to beg to have a decent piece of meat.Lack of management and training for sure.  I saw a couple seating next to my family leaving after more than 10 minutes of people ignoring them.  I won't be back there again after this poor experience.,1.0,"Dec 28, 2019"
"This is a solid 4.5 stars.  I am a big fan of churrascaria and my wife suggested we try this place.  My only knock on this place is that the salad bar is weak compared to other similar venues like Plataforma on 42nd (oh and they forgot to bring us our cheese bread) but hey, you don't eat at places like this for the salad.The meats were excellent on the day we went.  Everything from the numerous cuts of beef, chicken in bacon, sausages, pork loin and pork chops were perfectly seasoned and cooked well.  The servers also knew exactly which part of the meat to cut from to get the desired doneness.  The consensus favorite was the baby lamb chops.  We brought the poor guy back to our table about 5 times.  Side dishes were pretty meh but again, we're here for the meat.Desserts were really good here, especially the flan and the tres leches cake.  Service was excellent and they made sure we got to try everything we wanted and got us those cuts we wanted to eat again almost immediately.  Brazilian BBQ isn't exactly the cheapest meal but I felt that I got my money's worth here.  Definitely worth a try and I'll be back.",4.0,"Feb 17, 2015"
"Came here for a Saturday lunch when my Dad was visiting the city.Made the reservation on the Monday before and there were already limited options available. Apparently the special lunch price is only applicable from Sunday-Friday. Saturday has dinner prices all day at $62.95 per person. On the expensive side, but worth it for family. Would recommended coming during a restaurant week promotion or weekday lunch at $40 per person.You have a little card with a red side and green side. When the green side is up, prepare yourself for non-stop slew of meats coming to your table. Lamb, steak, chicken cooked in all different forms will appear in front of you. They advertise 14 different meats, but we only saw about 8 kinds. After eating all the meats, it got to the point where you seriously need some greenery in your system. Luckily the salad bar is pretty good. Different quinoa salads, beet salads, roasted/grilled vegetables, smoked salmon, avocado halves, bread, and soup.If you still have space and decide you want dessert, ask for the dessert menu. I was expecting a normal paper menu. Instead, the waiter came out with 8  desserts on a giant tray. My eyes almost fell out it all looked so delicious. Unfortunately we were too full, and decided not to order any.",4.0,"May 20, 2016"

"This is my 3rd Fogo's location and this one is by far the most fancy. The interiors wows definitely wows! Space is beautiful but they forgot about the restrooms it looks like...Restrooms only had one stall....REALLY?! My friend had a wedding dinner here and I was told that the reservation process was painful.  We had almost 20 ppl, you would think they would jump for that type of business....We were packed like sardines in our table. All our chairs were touching and it was impossible to get out at all....I literally had to jump and hop into and out of my seat to get out...Waiters were good with refilling appetizers.  A positive compared to other Fogo locations, but that's it.  The other negatives still hold true....Servers are rude when serving you different cuts of meat.  They get mad when you say no or don't leave enough space on your tables.Most of them know nothing about the meats they're serving.  When you ask to clarify, they snap at you!Geez....I would like to know what I'm eating...I also hate how they rush you to leave when you're time is up.  They clean up all your plates without even asking you, and everything you requested for food is totally ignored....Time after time, this has happened.

"TLDR: Good, but not great and pretty pricey. Place is huge. Staircases almost remind me of something Escher like. Dranks:Maybe bartender was having an off night but my Manhattan was bleh (and I just came from another bar with tasty ones)  and my caparinha had probably an entire lime in it, couldn't even finish it. I had my friend try it without telling him and it was funny watching his face when the bitterness hit. Cocktails shouldn't be funny. Alcohol is serious business! They also took quite awhile to come.You start off and it's like going into battle (in a good way). Literally just minutes apart someone is dropping off more meat! Its great. You try to keep pace lol. Its like you are fighting off the hordes of meat and your belly is your only defense. Best meats: bottom sirloin (super duper good), pork rib was great too but hardly comes around (came once and I asked for it a 2nd time), and beef rib was decent but I had to ask for it a few times and it only came at the end when I was reallllllly full. Also, the mashed potatoes are heaven. I usually never eat them at a place like this as they just take up meat space buuuut I couldn't help myself as they were very good. Not so good: the house steak (skip it) and the ""pricier"" cuts. Never had filet where I thought ehhhh s'okay. Sirloin was wack, ribeye was ok, but it's ribeye, should be drool worthy. So even though they offer higher quality meats than the low cost places, they weren't worth eating. I did like how they offer you choice of doneness tho. Hate overdone meats. Wasn't that impressed with the buffet/ salad bar section either as some other users seem to be. It's nice, but nothing to rave about or pull you away from the meats really. Service was very good for the most part. Place seems to run like clockwork.I had the flan for dessert and it was pretty good, although a tad heavy. Overall: I'd rather pay more and just go to an actual steakhouse to get a really good premium cut, or pay less and go to a lower end brazilian bbq.",3.0,"Dec 17, 2016"
"Ricardo was our server and very nice! The beef was amazing and it kept coming and coming. So tender and delicious, that part was great! The little chicken drumsticks were delicious.

I wish I could give this place at least 4.5 stars, but the hostesses were not welcoming or kind at check in.",4.0,"Mar 9, 2019"
Fogo de Chao was an amazing experience. The meats that were brought to the table were each more amazing than the last. The atmosphere was very upscale and it was also a very pricey place but well worth it.

As for desserts even each dessert was fantastic especially the creme brûlée I could've eaten 5 of those!,5.0,"Feb 16, 2017"
"Restaurant week 2016This was an interesting experience, to say the least. Our last min opentable reservation left us to dine at 11pm on a busy RW Friday night which I was fine with because I don't mind eating late anyway. Luckily, we called the day of to see if we can push it up a bit and had the reservation changed to 9pm that evening. We learned the hostess was surprised the 11pm opentable reservation even went through... because the restaurant closes at 11p. So imagine if we didn't call....whatever the issue is, they need to fix that glitch with opentable ASAP.When we arrived, our table was super dark! The 1 tiny light closest to use shone in between two tables and since we were by the wall I seriously could barely see what I was eating. Is this meat? Or fat? Oops, I won't know till I chew on it, and then decide if I'm going to have to spit it out. Great. Yea, forget taking pictures if you're at this crappy table. I asked for a candle for the table...to which the reply was ""we don't have any""... Um...YES YOU DO UPSTAIRS by the bar! I can see it from where I'm sitting *eyeroll*Aside from all that, it's an interesting system. First course you're going up to the salad bar for everything non-meat related. The servers will only bring you mashed potatoes, PDQ, and a few other starters. PDQ was fantastic! Salad bar was okay- not too bad. Once you return from the salad bar, servers will come by your table with various cuts of steak, lamb, sausages, chicken w/ bacon (skip this), etc. they'll carve it off in front of you and you use your tongs/forks to serve it onto your plate. A card is also left on your table that helps you communicate to the staff if you want them to come over with more meat. So green means ""keep it comin"" and if you flip to the red side It means ""pause, I'm still working on my heaps of food and/or digesting"". Service: the guys serving the meat were literally the most awesome......Everyone else was so blah- from the lighting issue to waving them down for forks/knives, down to ordering the drinks. Dessert was kinda boring: chocolate mousse or ny cheesecake. Other than that, the restaurant itself is stunning. There are SO many tables too- I don't think it's that difficult to get a rezzie. We saw available tables in the huge dining room throughout our dinner. All in all food was decent. But I didn't love the food enough to overlook everything else. Don't think I'll be back, sorry.",3.0,"Aug 8, 2016"
"I thought this place was average at best..My favorite meat, the lamb chops, were disgustingly gamy here.  The rest of their meats were  of average quality, with the best being their Picanha, or Sirloin.Their sides were very average as well.Not sure why this place gets such good reviews.

"All you can eat tasty tasty meat!! Quality cuts, nicely seasoned and cooked just right, you just cant go wrong with this.From the entrance you dont realize how big it's going to be inside and really, holy wow in midtown. This is one spacious spot. Walk in and check your coat if you want, have a drink at the bar or just head on down when they're ready and get seated. Staff is professional, nice and efficient (love this). Good food + great service is ALWAYS a win.Tables are not sitting on top of one another so you get your space, plus it makes it easier for the meat to speedily arrive and be sliced off onto your plate. The salad buffet is nice, has the usuals you'd expect and some nice touches like the entire wheel of parmigiana reggiano that is being slowly chiseled for your consumption. There's also a nice big bowl of super crisp bacon whch i unfortunatly couldnt partake in since i gave it up for lent *sigh* but everyone else at my table got some...We all tried something but we all knew to leave room for the main act, seriously tasty, quality cuts of grilled to perfection meat. Tell them how you like your meat cooked and they'll slice off just the right juicy piece for you. MMM MMM MMMNOTE: i like my meat med rare.*sirloin: yum*rib eye: my fave by far all night. so very very tasty and tender.*top sirloin: tasty*lamb: tasty with just the right amount of gaminess you'd expect. tender as well*parmesan crusted pork loin: awesome flavor but i found it a little dry. Quite salty due to the crust but it made it stand out from the other cuts*fogo steak: i wasn't given a med rare piece, it was really the last chunk on the sword so this was overcooked for me and a bit tough plus an 1 inch chunk at the end was just fat. i like marbling but a super thick chunk was too much, that just got trimmed off. this was my least favorite.Still sad I didnt get to try the bacon wrapped chicken or the bacon wrapped filet mignon but that'll be for next time!!!Despite all this food, i made sure i had room for dessert :) tried the tres leche and this was very creamy and rich and sweet. It was good but too much caramel flavor for my taste. there was more cream rather than cake so that overpowered it.Ah yes, we also did get drinks! *Superfruit lemonade: tastes like juice but u know there's a kick comin!*Moscato: sparkling red which looks like rose. sweet bubblyThey also have a fancy drink cart they wheel around the dining room for those in the mood for just liquor.Great time here.

"Came here for Fathers Day and was not disappointed.  I've would have given it 5 stars except for one thing.To start off, this is a steak house first and everything else second.  If you are looking for a huge salad bar I would say this is not the place. The meats here were cooked to perfection and the seasoning was spot on.  I am a purist and feel that if a steak is perfectly cooked and seasoned no sauces are necessary.Considering that in most steakhouses in the city would cost you the same price for one cut of meat here you get to have several for the same price.The Brazilian drinks were also very good.  I particularly enjoyed the passion fruit one. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful.Now why I deducted a star.  While eating I noticed other tables having some specialty drinks and asked the waitress what they were.  She said they were specials for the week.  That's all nice, but It would have been nice to be told about them in the beginning, instead of me having to ask.

"I was staying next door, at a very nice hotel, with my wife and two children (1 and 4).On the way back from dinner and sightseeing, my wife and I decided it would be nice to have a glass of wine and desert on our way back.Upon checking in I mentioned we were there for desert and wine only. We were taken downstairs. When the waitress came and I mentioned we would like the wine and desert menu she excused herself. She came back with someone else who told us those seats were reserved for guests who wanted the ""full experience"".Confusion ensued between us and several different people who were trying to figure out how we got to the table. I was told we needed to see if there was a table upstairs we could go to for us. I asked if I needed to go up and check and was told by a manager that he would do it, and if there was nothing up there he would rather us stay in the ""full experience"" area than leave.While he was gone we were approached again by some sort of manager or lead, asking us again to go back upstairs.Eventually we were told to stay where we were. We had our two deserts and two glasses of wine and left as soon as we could.We definitely had the ""full Fogo experience"".My 5* hotel recommended them the next day as a place to catch a game and I said no thank you, out of principle.I've dined in their locations in other major cities and it was fine, but the lack of communication and embarrassment we endured in front of other guest will make it so I never dine in this establishment again.Hope others enjoy the ""full experience"".",3.0,"Jan 20, 2016"

"It was my first time at a Brazilian churrascaria. It's nestled right across the street from the MoMA. There are three levels to the restaurant. Downstairs consists of a traditional elegant dining room, whereas the third level features a fully equipped bar. Start yourself off with a Passionate Caipirinha, one of Brazil's national cocktails. Drinking this reminded me of a subtle mixture of both a mojito and a daiquiri. Quite tasty and refreshing!The full churrasco experience at Fogo de Chao will cost you $39.95 for lunch and $62.95 for dinner. You'll begin at the gourmet self-serve salad bar. There are a variety of options which consists of your basic fare but nothing amazing enough that enticed me to return. Besides, my mission here is to eat meat and it would be a no-brainer to fill up on anything other than meat. Each diner will find a two-sided coaster on the table that's pretty self-explanatory. When you want the meats to flow, green is the way to go. FOOD -- Undoubtedly, a meat lovers dream. We were bombarded with about 13 different kinds of meat which included: house specialty prime sirloin, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, filet mignon, bacon wrapped filet mignon, rib-eye, pork sausage, parmesan encrusted pork loin, lamb chops, leg of lamb, chicken sausage, chicken leg, and bacon wrapped chicken breast. If that's not enough, there are also starchy sides that were consistently replenished. This comprised of fried plantains, garlic mashed potatoes, crispy polenta fries, and warm cheese rolls. HIGHLIGHTS -- The house specialty prime sirloin, top sirloin, and leg of lamb were the standouts of the night. The house specialty had a good robust flavor. The top sirloin had a nice crisp while maintaining the juiciness of the meat. As for the leg of lamb, it was grilled to perfection with no hint of gaminess whatsoever. CONS -- I'm all for seasoning and flavors but some cuts were just overly salty. The seasoning wasn't subtle enough to complement the natural flavors of each cut. For the majority, I felt the meat quality was just average. Our first rounds of meats were excellent, however everything onwards seemed dried-out which probably resulted from reheating. Another imperfection is the inconsistencies of the cuts. I requested all of my cuts to be medium-rare, however I received most pieces medium well. Why ask if you can't deliver? My last complaint would be the overwhelming flow of meats. We literally received all 13 meats in a matter of minutes, all stacked right besides each other. Perhaps I'm picky, but I prefer to eat my food warm especially when it comes to meat. Final verdict? If you haven't dined here already, brace yourselves for a full comatose meal. It's certainly a different dining experience and the concept is fantastic. I enjoyed watching the meat-cutters coming out with various skewers of meats that were ready to be carved at the table. However, inconsistency took away from the experience. For this price tag, I'd rather splurge on a better cut of steak cooked to my preference than to stuff myself with a variety of mediocre meats. For those that are hesitant in dining here due to the price tag, restaurant week offers the full churrasco experience for only half the price ($38) with the difference being only in the selection of certain meats so take full advantage!",4.0,"Oct 21, 2016"
"Ate there in February with some out of town friends before all of this mess began.  Great food, service and ambiance.  Was able to have a good conversation (not too loud like a lot of places) and I hadn't been to a Brazilian Steakhouse in a while so I was ready and full by the end.  Salad bar was clean and well stocked, meats were all cooked well and they kept them coming (even the pricier pieces).  Will go back!",5.0,"Jul 1, 2019"
"This place is great if you really love meat. I don't eat red meat, but I came for someone's birthday. The pork and chicken options were still delicious. All the meats sounded yummy. Some were wrapped in bacon, others seasoned with herbs and spices. And I know you shouldn't fill up on bread at a place like this, but the rolls are soft and sooooo cheesy! I literally couldn't help myself! I'd say the price is pretty high, especially for someone who's just having the three white meat options. For those enjoying steak filets, it's probably more worth it.",3.0,"Mar 12, 2016"
"Let me break this down so its objective. Service: 5 stars Food: 5 StarsBathroom: 5 Stars (Not Crowded) Camila (my server) was amazing. She was wonderful, polite and very professional in everything that she did. I was surprise to see how knowledgeable she was on some of the food served there. She isn't like most servers I've had. Very on point. My glass of water was always filled (I was thirsty). I highly recommend eating at this place and if any of you guys go ask for her. She's awesome. As for the food was very fulfilling. The food wait wasn't long at all. Soon as I turned my head the meat was already out lol. I like how they kept bringing more and more different kinds of meat to the table once we finished. The steak was amazing !!!!! Highly recommended for food and service ! Thank you Camila !!!",5.0,"Jun 9, 2016"
"Eh. It was okay. I don't see what the big deal is about. The salad bar was one step above Golden Corral and the meat was salty and flavorless (and I believe they serve those 3 free sides as palate cleansers since the meat is so salty and the sides are so bland). I think the people reviewing this place are tourists who are excited to be in New York and don't want their excitement dampened by admitting they visited a subpar joint and paid too much for it.Also take note, solo diners: this place will make you feel really awkward. Everyone there is in a group or as a couple. I would wait to dine with a group or SO and you can wait til neverhood since you won't be missing much.",5.0,"Jun 27, 2019"

"Brazilian steakhouse aka Churrascaria = MEAT GALORE! Unlimited assorted meats, sides, and salads!! Churrascaria roughly translates in Portuguese for ""barbecue"". Servers will come around your table with a long spear stick of some sort of meat, each server carrying a different type of meat cut that they will cut in front of you and serve it to your plate. Beforehand, you get to head to the salad bar, which has a nice gourmet quality selection of things to pile on your plate... Some things I was actually impressed from the salad bar was the smoked salmon, the sweet&spicy bacon, fresh mozzarella, and I highly suggest to get a load of their refreshing apple salad to take mini bites in between your meats to help cut through all that constant endless meat flavor and saltiness you'll be having and I can't forget about the pesto sauce from the bar that you could use to dip some of your meat in as well! Let's jump to the meat: all the red meat has a choice from rare, med-rare, med, or medium-well. Med-rare is the way to go for me and has been spot on from here. Majority of the meats has been surprisingly very juicy and seasoned well... and even overly seasoned for a few. My favorites were the house special prime sirloin, top sirloin, and bottom sirloin. The chicken legs had a great flavor in wine. The pork ribs would've been one of my faves since it was falling off the bone but it was the only one that was too heavily salted. Lamb legs were also great. My least favorite were the Parmesan crusted pork tenderloin, it was dry and the Parmesan cheese just didn't do it for me, also the bacon wrapped filet mignon. Your table will also be accompanied with constant refills on filling starchy table sides of mash potatoes, fried polenta fries, caramelized bananas and and warm freshly buttered bread... Which all except the polenta fries I enjoyed as well!Dessert choices were : key lime pie, ny cheesecake, or chocolate mousse cake which were all mediocre.It may get overwhelming so prepare yourselves and don't feel the need to rush! You get a card on the table, red side up means you don't want them to bother you and bring anymore meat for the meantime, flip green side up whenever you're ready to eat more! The same meat will constantly keep coming out hot and fresh all night, so again use the card wisely to pace yourself if you don't want them to bombard you all at once. Other than that, no complaints on the service; they're friendly, fast and efficient. The dining room is quite elegant looking, high ceilings, 3 floors, with a much more peaceful ambiance.I always wanted to try Fogo De Chao and was very happy about them participated for RW which is a very generous thing of them... They're the most worth it for your money on restaurant week! I left extremely bloated, and satisfied with the meal for just $38. However on daily normal nights, it's always $60 which is quite hefty.",4.0,"Jan 24, 2016"
"Always liked Fogo de Chão back in Brazil (even though there are much much more options for steak houses in Brazil) the prices in Brazil are just as high. I love how the staff just got into the whole Brazilian warm welcoming spirit, it feels just like I'm dining in Brazil (since most of the staff in Fogo de Chão in Brazil speak English it was really cool to see American waiters speaking Portuguese). Take it easy on the salad bar and the side dishes since they're always available. And don't forget to drink Guaraná. And the Papaya cream desert is a Brazilian classic so do try it.",5.0,"Mar 4, 2017"
"Impressed! The restaurant, staff, food and guests are wonderful!CLEANLINESS:The restaurant was well kempt with servers in clean uniforms. The bathroom looked as though it was freshly cleaned and stocked.FRIENDLINESS:Each one of the servers, managers, hostesses, and guests seemed to be genuinely kind. The servers in particular worked hard to ensure that everyone in the restaurant was taken care of.TASTE:The meat was absolutely amazing! I really appreciated the diversity of food at the food bar and the fact that it was stocked with fresh food.RECOMMENDATIONS:The only constructive criticism that I have is that some of the food near the food bar, which was supposed to be hot, was warm at best. Other than that, I really enjoyed my time there. It really seems like a place where everyone can go to have a nice meal and a nice experience.",5.0,"Mar 1, 2017"
"Seeing as how my bestie is Brazilian, she knows a thing or two about Brazilian barbecue.  We've tried Churrasceria Plataforma and were unimpressed.  When she heard Fogo de Chao was opening in midtown, she had to check it out.  I, of course, being the good friend that I am, joined her.  First, you don't realize the scale of this place from the outside.  You could almost walk by it if there were no sign outside the door directing you to the revolving doors.  When you walk in, you feel like you're not in New York.  The place is huge!  So much space!  You start thinking about the rent on a place like this and you start to realize the price of the meal is pretty decent when you factor in the amount of space and service you get at this place.  We started off with drinks at the main bar.  Alex was our bartender and he was amazing.  We've done the whole caipirinha thing one too many times and wanted to try something new.  So we tried the Superfruit Lemonade and Brazilian Martini.  The lemonade was refreshing with fresh fruit inside.  But the favorite was definitely the Brazilian Martini.  Yes, these are girly drinks, but they pack quite a punch when you're not looking.  Alex also made our friend a very delicious drink that was not on the menu which he calls the Tropical Caipirinha which also comes with fresh fruit bites.  That one was my favorite.Now on to the dining portion.  You walk down the stairs to a labyrinth of tables.  To your right you have the salad bar.  If you've never been to a Brazilian barbecue spot, I suggest you not eat for an entire day before going because this is basically like an all-you-can-eat buffet - on a fancier scale of course.  I decided to just stick to the salad bar and not do the meat portion.  My friend went with the meat.  They come around with all cuts of meat, pork, chicken, sausage - you name it, they serve it.  She said the quality of meat was superior to those of other places she has tried in the city.  The salad bar had enough food to fill me up on my first trip there.  They have different salads - that apple salad was very delicious.  The smoked salmon was also fresh.  I really enjoyed the coconut haddock.  Along with the meat, my friend enjoyed sides of mashed potato, polenta and pal de queijo (cheese bread).  The service was amazing.  No sooner did we finish the last of the polenta than the waiter came with a filled plate of more polenta.  Everyone was very attentive and helpful.  When it came time for dessert, we were torn between usual favorites like the molten chocolate cake or unique items like their signature papaya cream so we ended up trying four (there were four of us btw, so we don't seem so gluttonous).  Of the four, the favorites were the flan, the creme brule and the molten chocolate cake.  The papaya cream was not too sweet and would have been delicious on its own, but when you takes bites of it between all the other crazy sweet desserts, you couldn't truly appreciate it.All in all, Fogo de Chao was a wonderful experience.  Definitely a splurge but totally worth it.  Come hungry and leave in a food coma.",5.0,"Feb 23, 2014"

"**BAR/BAR FOOD REVIEW*I hosted a company event here for about 20 people upstairs in the bar area.  Plenty of space and seating on the weekdays to go around.  It never got crowded... pretty quiet all night.  The space is quite nice, as this is pretty much still a brand new establishment.  One thing though - its FREEZING upstairs - bring a coat or you'll catch a cold or something.Since I basically had no budget, I was able to order a plethora of things from the bar menu (sadly, just the bar menu, no dinner here).I pretty much ordered everything off the bar menu, so here's what was memorable:- Grilled shrimp skewers were pretty much still cold and RAW the first time they came out.  I had to send them back.  If you've never had raw shrimp, I don't recommend it.- Rib eye - delicious, if it comes out the correct temperature that you ordered.  I would recommend this over the filet mignon.- Shrimp cocktail - pricey, but these things are massive and delicious.  The spicy cocktail sauce is one of the best I've had.- Flan - amazing.- Creme brûlée - also amazing.Service was great - at first I thought our bartender hated us, but he was actually very friendly and invited me back anytime.  Definitely a great place if you're looking to host a company or friendly happy hour.",4.0,"May 21, 2014"
"Just a short walk from MoMA. A great place to go after you've worked up an appetite and you'll need one!  If you know the word  ""churrascaria"" then you know what you're in for!  You start with a buffet filled with all manner of fixins' for salads, there's fruit, cold cuts, there's a carrot ginger soup, cheeses etc.  You load up, return to your seat flip your disc from red to the green side and a parade of proteins are offered at your table and only stops when you flip your disc to the red side.  Mashed potatoes, caramelized and fried bananas are are delivered at your table as well as fresh rolls.  A great Brazilian steakhouse experience.Gotta pay to play though.  Our meal for 2 was $106.  That with a single glass of Malbec and no dessert.  Next time I try the cocktail menu.  Oh yeah, there'll be a next time.",4.0,"May 29, 2017"
"Went here for restaurant week and it was an amazing experience. For $42 a person it is very worth it. Definitely one of the best deals restaurant week can offer. You have full access to their salad bar which has high quality cold salads, fruits, cheeses, veggies. They are all prepared in a unique and delicious way so it's not your average salad bar. We also had access to 13 out of 17 of the meats they offer. The servers come up very quickly the moment you flip your card to indicate you would like more meat. The salad bar is exquisite and the meat cuts are so so good. The best part? You still get dessert :) cheesecake, mousse, or key lime pie. Not to mention this whole time you get free, refillable sides of their magical cheese bread, fried bananas, mashed potatoes, fried polenta. Make sure you come with as empty a stomach as possible",5.0,"Jan 30, 2018"
"Ok, where do I start! This was one of the biggest disappointments I've had on Yelp. I really on other people's opinions to determined if I want to go to that particular restaurant.  Yelp reviewers were wrong. The meats where extremely flavorless and the Buffett was way to simple. I've been to a few Brazilian restaurants like this and this one hands down was the worst. To top it off, it's $60 a person and they claim to have over 60 types of meats but only seen about 13. This place is way to expensive for the quality of food. I will not be retiring here. The plus side....ambiance to die for!",2.0,"Aug 26, 2016"
"This is one of those places where when people ask me how it is, I pause for a moment and then say ""ehh...it's not bad.""I guess dining at a Brazilian steakhouse will never be ideal for me since I can't eat my money's worth; for almost $70 per person I need to leave my button ""green"" and having the waiters keep coming over with meat all night to feel like it was worth it. On top of that, a waiter came around with a jumbo shrimp cocktail and asked if we'd like some. My hand was halfway in motion to taking one until he tried to casually mention that it was an extra $10 or something like that to which I quickly retracted my hand.My friends liked the garlic marinated sirloin the most but I guess I'm just a ribeye kind of person and I wish they had garlic marinated ribeye as well. The house steak was the next favorite followed by the beef ribs. I probably spent most of my time at the salad bar which had a pretty extensive selection of veggies, cheeses and salami to pair with the meat. All in all, a good place to try, but probably will have to skip breakfast and lunch to make the next trip worthwhile.",3.0,"Nov 16, 2014"
"This place is great for at least one visit,  it there are better values and be on guard. I received great service on our last trip for dinner.

"Great salad bar selection. The prosciutto was very fresh thick and perfect. They also had sides for the table including mashed potatoes, cheese bread, yuca fries, and plantains. They have a great of variety of meats especially beef they also have chicken ribs and lamb. I gave the chicken a try but stuck with the beef. My favorite was the Picanha medium rare, I had three servings of that. It was coated with sea salt and was melt in your mouth goodness. The other cuts of steak were good but not as good due to their toughness. We came for restaurant week, and didn't order drinks so the total plus tip and tax was $48 pp which includes dessert. We were so full that we all took it to go. I definitely had my moneys worth and will definitely be back, for restaurant week for sure but even on the regular.",5.0,"Feb 7, 2016"

"SO. OVERWHELMING. This experience is not for the weak-stomached. We went with a group of 20+ people for a holiday outing. The salad bar was not as big as I had expected - expect cheese and prosciutto plates, hearts of palm, broccolis, asparagus, regular greens, red peppers, etc. The waiters came around and offered us caipirinhas - the Brazilian national cocktail that closely resembles a mojito but switch out rum and bubbles for cachaca - so sweet and oh so dangerous! The private space we booked got very rowdy within the hour thanks to these babies! Each person gets a circle tag on the table with red and green sides. Red for when you don't want to be carved more meat and green for ""yes please bring more."" Being the noob that I was, I left the green side up expecting the waiters to give me time to cut and taste my steak, but nope, they came one after the other without giving me the chance to finish a conversation with the person sitting across from me. I felt like my meal was constantly being interrupted, yet if I flipped my tag over to red, I'd still feel hungry. The servers definitely could have talked slower or skipped me if they saw that I was in the middle of cutting another piece of meat, but oh well, I guess they just didn't want me to miss all the types of cuts they had to offer.The steak sirloin was great but the chicken was very dry.

"I am extremely disappointed with the service at Fogo de Chao. This review is NOT for the food. The food is absolutely delicious. We came here on a Tuesday evening, with a reservation from open table and I had stated that it was our anniversary.The service is SLOW. They did NOT explain the menu. We did NOT know who our waiter is. We had to flag down several different waiters so that we could obtain the sides that were already included with the all you can eat. The gentlemen that bring the different types of meats are very lovely and did their best to accommodate us. The waiters were MIA. It's pathetic that we order a bottle of wine and we have to pour the bottle ourselves. Unfortunately, I think this is the last time that we will be coming here. Our last two evenings here (Valentine's Day and this evening) were very disappointing in terms of quality of service. They waiters should be more attentive to the needs of their patrons.

"I stopped by recently since I heard that Fogo was participating in Restaurant Week. I absolutely cannot resist a good steak. With Fogo offering unlimited steak (and other meats) for only $38?! You wouldn't believe how quickly I booked it out of class to make it to dinner. I got there and received a warm welcome from the hostess who directed me downstairs to my party. We were seated directly beneath the stairs, at a big corner table (there were 8 of us), and we got started right away. The card system was explained and pretty easy to understand. Flip it red, and you're okay for now - no meat needed. Green, and any server that notices will stop by your table to offer you whatever they have. In theory, a great system, but in reality, a little more difficult to execute. It's hard for the servers to always see if your card is green if the rest of the table is red, or even see your cards at all if you're not in the center of the restaurant. Still, I was pretty happy with the service. Everyone smiled, was kind, and treated us no differently knowing we were stopping by for the Restaurant Week deal. On to the food. The steaks were great, although I kept getting a variation between well done and medium rare, even though I asked for medium every single time. Of course, that affected how the steaks tasted to me. The caramelized bananas were the standout appetizer, and I personally liked the chocolate mousse more than the cheesecake (didn't get to try the key lime pie), but neither dessert was really mind-blowing. I think overall, it's a great deal. Come with people that have a bottomless stomach like I did, and you're sure to get your money's worth. Service is decent, and the experience was fun. Good for a one time visit at the very least. They lost one star for the wait time between servings when the servers just passed over our table because they weren't looking closely enough, and the other star for the variation in the quality of their food.",3.0,"Jan 26, 2016"

"It's been years since I've played any childhood games but at my night at Fogo, I had the chance to pay the ultimate ""red light, green light"" game.After a long day in the city without having had consumed anything else except my regular breakfast eggs, Fogo was both a gift and a curse. Sixty dollar rodizo aka bring on the meats!First they give a little round card that is red on one side and green on the other. I was adamant on keeping my card flipped to green as I was afraid of missing out on something good. Within a few minutes, I had 6 different cuts of meat on my plate and had eaten 3 pieces of steak already. I had to flip the card to red. My date on the other hand kept the card flipped to green. And that's exactly the color his face turned 15 minutes into the meal! You can easily make yourself sick here by eating way too much way too fast. But it's hard to just say enough when the cuts are delicious. I battled myself with the flipping of the card from red back to green and back to red. At one point a server just missed my green card and stopped dead on his tracks when I flipped back to red while he raced to offer me some more food. This type of red light, green light game I really enjoyed.Also ordered these huge pineapple alcoholic drinks. It was a special concoction that included bits of pineapple inside a fresh pineapple. Well worth the $25 price tag.All of the cuts I tasted I really enjoyed. The bacon-wrapped tenderloin was probably my least favorite and the spare ribs were surprising really tasty.Tip: don't miss out on the caramelized bacon at the salad bar. Amazing.Great place for a date or an opportunity to gain 10 pounds in one sitting ... regardless I'd come back again.",5.0,"Oct 10, 2015"
"I get together with a large group of people every month at Fogo's bar for happy hour. No matter how crowded it is, the staff is always happy to see us and always treats us like royalty. The group consists of a variety of people from different cultures - what you'd call a 'tough crowd' - and everyone is always really happy to gather there time and time again. The food is also amazing, needless to say. I've been there on a normal day AND for restaurant week and was served well, no difference on quality of food or service.Lastly, the manager is very approachable which is definitely rare in this town. Will keep on returning for both happy hours and dinner.",5.0,"Jun 30, 2019"
"I highly recommend it.  We had an amazing corporate cocktail party at Fogo de Chao.  The service and the food were impeccable. The ambiance perfect, and the location in the heart of Manhattan, in front of MOMA, couldn't be better.  I recommend the caipirinhas, the churrasco, the grilled cheese (Brazilian style) and all the sliders.   Thank you, Fogo de Chao, can't wait to organize the next event with you again!!

"Amazing experience here. I've been to Fogo De Chao in Los Angeles before but this venue is really great and it has a large space. I am a little biased because I came here for my anniversary but did not have a reservation and the hostess kindly got me a table promptly. The salad bar and the desserts are on point and the service is so fast and courteous. Once you flip over that meat card, you will get endless meats until you need to beg them to stop lol",5.0,"Jan 24, 2016"
Hmmmmm. Kind of disappointed. There is a better steak house in queens on northern blvd. all the meat was extended salty. The rice was cold. The best meat was probably the sausage with a little bit of spicy to it. However the service was good. Everyone was nice.,3.0,"Dec 4, 2018"
"Came here once for my boyfriend's birthday and overall loved the experience of a Brazilian steakhouse. Service was great, the salad bar/appetizer bar was great, but the quality of the meat was pretty average. I've had a Brazilian steakhouse experience in Miami before, and I have to say that I expected better quality in NYC. Nevertheless, nothing about the meats stood out or disappointed me. They were just decent meat. As a side note, I'd give the staff a plus for helping me surprise my boyfriend with a cake! Overall, I would give this restaurant 3 stars for the average steak quality for the higher price, but the ambiance and kind service bumped it up to 4 stars in the end for me!",4.0,"Feb 1, 2018"
"This review is long overdue because I was actually here for this summer's Restaurant Week.  Nevertheless, here are my thoughts...The value that comes with Restaurant Week's offer is great here.  Although there are maybe two or three particular cuts that aren't offered with for those paying for the Restaurant Week offer, that which is available is more than enough.  There are certainly some cuts that I preferred over others but as a whole I'd rate the meats 4 of 5.  Honestly, it was some time ago so I can't even single out which one(s) I liked best.  There's a large variety of salads and small bites at the salad bar which for the most part were also rather good.  The table is served with sides of mashed potatoes and plantains that you have the option of ordering more of.  The service was decent and I was pleased with how often the meats circulated and visited the table.  For anyone that would be interested in going for Restaurant Week, do keep in mind you have the option of ordering a dessert as well.  I tried a bite of one or two of them and I'd say they were alright.",4.0,"Oct 4, 2016"
"Absolutely LOVE this steakhouse! The 3rd year coming here for restaurant week... Walk in excited and walk out satisfied. Food: wide variety of fresh cut meats from pichana and Alcatra sirloin, pork loin filet, lamb, pork ribs, to chicken wrapped in bacon. All the meats were carried out fresh from the kitchen to the tables. If you have your card flipped to the green side then you will be approached with meats and it was then your choice to decide if you wanted that meat as well as how you would like it (well done, medium rare, etc). They were cooked to perfection. Melt in your mouth perfection. Even the ""well done"" cuts didn't look overly dry. My favorites were the pork ribs and pichana sirloin. Meats were all -you -can -eat, along with the open salad bar (good variety as well). They also provided side dishes to the table such as fried yuca, caramelized bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheesy bread. Almost everyone at my table loves the fried Yuca. I personally liked the caramelized bananas when I paired it with meats (Mouth watering just reminiscing about it...)Service: pretty good service. Greeted kindly by the hostess and our waiter Aaron (hopefully spelled his name right. Aaron was very patient and attentive from the start. We were pretty indecisive when it came to deciding on drinks. He made sure to provide us drink menus and different recommendations both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Much appreciated. During our dining, he made sure to ask how we were doing and, at one point, help us grab the attention of the servers because the meats were not offered to us for a while. I admit, I did get a little frustrated and hangggry but Aaron took care of us :) at the end when we were preparing to  leave he even took the time to come over and thank us for dining, as well as apologize for the wait time we experienced for the meats. Aaron gets 5 stars just on his own! Thank you!Recommend? I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. A great deal for restaurant week but a great deal nonetheless outside of RW. Beautiful delicious cuts that is all-you-can-eat, AND served how you want. Dream come true. I think I'm coming back for my birthday next time :D",5.0,"Jan 28, 2016"
"The layout for the restaurant is nice, butttttt you can sense a bit of attitude as soon as you sit down to order. My boyfriend surprised me and took me here for my birthday. The manager had a major stick up his ass, the wait staff presents themselves as if they are doing you a favor by waiting on you and I decided that we would never visit this establishment again.This review is so short because I refuse to even give this place another moment of my time by even writing about them.",1.0,"Apr 13, 2018"
"What I was hoping to be a great dining experience, since I am a huge fan of Rodizio, just turned out to be a disappointing and a horrible one. I never felt offended eating at a restaurant until tonight. We came here after seeing a dinner promo in facebook and was well aware of the fine print, however my friend failed to read those minute details. So when we sat at our table, we have to decide whether we want to get the full rodizio or the the promo after my friend learned that prime cuts were not included in the promo, so it took us a little while to decide. I would settle for the promo because I'm not really hungry to start with since I had a late lunch. But still ended up getting the full rodizio just for the heck, since we're already there. I feel like that kinda gave our waiter an impression of us that we are being cheap. He then ask us if we want something to drink. I then ask for the wine list, he then responded a bottle cost roughly 100$ which made me and my friend raised our brows and look at each other to make sure we heard him really saying that. Then when I ordered a glass of malbec, he then clarified to me that price is for a glass only! That point, I almost lost it and have to raised my voice a little bit because this idiot probably thinks this is my first time eating in a restaurant in the city! So that just kinda ruined the whole experience. No matter how I wanted to enjoy the food, I just completely lost my appetite. I have been to Fogo in Philly and Chicago, and other rodizio restaurants in and other states as well as different parts of the world but this is by far the worst mainly because of that incident.",1.0,"Oct 23, 2019"
"I've been wanting to try a Fogo de Chao establishment for awhile now but just never had the chance. So my friends and I planned and traveled to NYC to try it out. We went around dinnertime Saturday. I was very surprised that we were able to walk in without a reservation needed and the host led us to our table right away. The inside is beautiful, modern, very airy. Love the display of the wine upstairs. I really like the lights dimly lit in these types of restaurants, makes the atmosphere more romantic and relaxing. The salad bar has more than just salads, so many sides that you can eat accompanying your meats. Smoked salmon was a hit, a worthy try. I really enjoyed the apple salad as well as the fresh strawberry salad with cheese sprinkled on top.The filet mignon and lamb cuts were da bomb! The ultimate stars of the show. Filet mignon was so tender and melt in your mouth. Get it at medium rare and you're good to go! It was the perfect color. Lamb was very delicious as well, ya can't go wrong with three cuts of lamb: lamb ribs, leg of lamb, and I can't remember the third at that moment! Well, can you blame me? I was in a meat coma. Next time, I'm saving my belly for only filet mignon and lamb!So glad I went here and planning to come back for the second round!",4.0,"May 5, 2014"

Went here for my friend birthday and was impressed on how the restaurant looks like.

The service is 5 stars and all the staff are friendly and making sure that we are having what we need. At the end of our meal they surprised my friend with a complimentary birthday dessert!!

"I came with a group of about 12 for a surprise birthday dinner.  We were seated on the lower level in a quiet corner all the way in the back, which was perfect to surprise our friend when he came down the stairs since the table can't be seen until after just turning the corner.  There is a huge bar on the upper level, which we did not go to.As a first timer to a Brazilian style steakhouse, the dining experience was unlike any other.  Each of us had a coaster with a red and green side, and as long as the green side of your coaster was up you were offered every cut of meat available by the staff walking around the tables.  If you didn't want them to come around to you anymore, simply turn the coaster over to the red side.I tried nearly everything, including the chicken and pork which I regretted later, and my faves were the bacon wrapped filet and ribeye.  The salad bar had a decent selection of fresh cheeses, salads, olives, etc.  The sides were also pretty good, especially the mashed potatoes.The service we received was impeccable.  The staff coordinated with our friend who set up the surprise dinner, cut the outside cake she brought, and packed up the leftovers for her.  Someone was always checking up on us throughout the dinner.Price point was a bit high as it is an all-you-can-eat price with quality meats, but for a special occasion it was fine.",4.0,"May 30, 2016"

"Loved the food. I love spicy food and their picanha was on  point. Well I came for the steaks and the steaks were super juicy and delicious. I wish they also had the pineapple one with cinnamon and sugar, but they didn't. I gave it 4 stars, cause I do think it's overpriced. But then again, it's a big restaurant in the middle of Manhattan, so I guess that's expected. It's definitely a place for  big crowds, you won't have a quiet romantic dinner for two here, cause it's quite loud. They have a big variety of cocktails and beverages, so overall a good spot.",4.0,"Sep 4, 2018"
"Exemplary Churrascaria experience in the heart of manhattan.  Everything was supremely well executed in my many times visiting the various locations around the US.  The NY one does not disappoint.  Preparation of the meats is perfect.  Service is attentive.  Atmosphere is appropriately classy and yet informal.  An impressive space design has Oak barrels and wine bottles lining the walls hearkening to the stellar wine list.  Salad bar is tremendous.   Do yourself a favor and don't even consider any other Churrascaria- at least in NY.   You're in good hands here, and you will leave having enjoyed one of the best meals of your life.

The salad buffet was stocked with a delectable selection of greens, and cold appetizers including a large assortment of marinated vegetables, cheeses, and smoked salmon. My date and I each had three servings from the salad bar as we enjoyed it that much !! What can you say about the meats ? They were super tender and seasoned perfectly.

I want to give this establishment NO STARS. BUT TO ENTER A REVIEW I AM FORCED TO GIVE IT 1 STAR. So I go out with the Mrs. Once a week for date night. We are big fans of Brazilian Steakhouses. This place as beautiful inside as the building is outside.  However there was not match with its food or service. Our waiter took almost 25 mins to take our drink order (we ordered a bottle of red wine) took another 30 mins for the wine to get to the table. We only saw our waiter 2 more times over the next almost 90 minutes we were there. Once he stopped and topped off our wine. And once to bring us the check.  The meat was severely overseasoned. The salt content was almost unbearable. My Wife couldn't even eat the meat she was given. After trying multiple items they brought to the table I suddenly felt very warm and flustered. My stomach tightened up. I felt like I was going to faint. I walked to the bathroom and began to vomit. Almost to the point of tears from the pain. While I was in the bathroom she decided maybe ordering desert would be ok. She ordered the flan.  What she received as flan was an absolute disgrace. Looked like an overcooked egg custard. There were no air pockets in the flan and it tasted like straight egg. The strawberry that came with it was so under ripe the fork wouldn't pierce it. That was the last draw. We left. Not even 10 feet out the door my wife began to vomit. The process repeated several more times on the way to the parking garage. We were forced to stop FIVE more times on the trip home to vomit. And spent most of the remainder of our night at home in the bathrooms. I myself am a Chef. To me this was one of If not the most horrific experience I've ever had to endure. I find when you go out to a top rated zagat restaurant. Spend almost $300 on dinner for 2 people only to get sick from it  that right there is a valid sign why being clean and conscious of your materials and ingredients is so important! Undercooked meat and cross contamination is VERY DANGEROUS!Seasoning should be added for flavor enhancement. Not dumped onto beautiful cuts of meat like it was. Respect your ingredients. And more importantly respect the meat you serve. These animals give their lives to feed you. If you don't know how to properly season. You should not be on the line. Save your money and avoid this place at all cost!,1.0,"Sep 3, 2017"
"Meat, plain & simpleThe food speaks for itself. A massive salad bar and endless meat is a version of heaven I wouldnt mind spending eternity in.

"Beautiful space, perfect location (steps from the MoMA)Both hostess' seemed new.  We asked about the parking out front and they appeared shocked as if it were something they'd never thought about.  The dining room is huge and located downstairs from the main entrance.  There are ALOT of stairs but the walk is totally worth it.  Tables are tiny.  The four of us were seated at a four top and kept having our handbags bumped constantly from the backs of our chairs.  There doesn't appear to be coat check here either.Salad bar was standard.  Brazilian cheese bread was in the shape of a muffin and had a very strange texture - kept arriving cold.  Meats were good but the standouts (garlic lamb and picanha) both made an appearance once and never came back.  Drinks were good!  Service was okay.  Our waiter came over to our table with another waiter at one point and just stood over us.  When we inquired if they needed the table (we had just ordered a full round of drinks AND dessert) he quickly said no and they both scurried off.   A few minutes later he walked passed us with his coat on and we never saw him again.

"Throwing down another restaurant week review up in here.Short Story: You're an idiot if you don't take advantage of the restaurant week deal at Fogo de Chao. Idiot. (If you're unable to partake in the gloriousness of a meaty meal, I exclude you from judgement.)Long Story: $38 for all you can eat food is not bad. It's actually somewhat average in this town. When you throw in the fact that you get access to a lovely cold bar with fresh veggies, cheese, and cold cuts like salami, prosciutto, and smoked salmon* in addition to prime cuts of meat hot off the grill, it's bumped up a notch above the typical buffet.Now let's talk about the meat. Holy cow. And pig. And lamb. There's something fantastic about people walking around with giant cuts of meat and offering you said meat. With a late dinner reservation and lack of energy due to hunger, I perked up real fast as soon as I saw the food---top sirloin, bottom sirloin, rib eye, beef tenderloin, pork ribs, pork sausage, leg of lamb. You know I ate it all. My favorite was the alcatra (top sirloin). It was so juicy and flavorful. Everything was perfectly cooked, and I love how they carry meat cooked to varying levels of doneness on the big churrasco skewers so you have options on top of your options.You also get a side of garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta, caramelized bananas, and cheesy bread. Man, that bread was good. It was light, slightly chewy, and as my boyfriend put it, tasted like goldfish (the cracker, not the fish). You also get a choice of 3 desserts for restaurant week. I went with the chocolate mousse cake but it wasn't fantastic. The meat was the real star of the show.* I've never seen a giant platter of all you can eat smoked salmon before, and as I LOVE smoked salmon, it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in a long while. No words can describe that platter. I almost cried.",5.0,"Aug 6, 2015"

No, unfortunately.. wrong.The salad bar/appetizer buffet was just as understocked and underwhelming as ever - plates of hearts of palm, black olives, assortments of basic cheeses, fruit platters (why do I want fruit before I feast on meat, again?), really nasty potato salad, ambrosia- and the meats (again we got about 8 options total) are either unseasoned, over-salted or in the case of their 'garlic steak' entirely coated so you can't see or taste the meat beneath the garlic. Other rodizios I've been to have a much better salad bar/appetizer buffet (pasta salad, guacamole, sushi, cocktail shrimp, etc.) and their meats come out sizzling hot out of the spitfire and full of flavor and meat juice. Fogo's meat is dry half the time.. even when you get medium rare! I sit here writing this without having eaten since breakfast and remembering this meal does not make me hungry whatsoever; I'd be more enthused about paying top dollar for taco bell than this place.If you want rodizio in Midtown, Churrascaria Plataforma is your place. If you want a good steak, there are countless better options than Fogo. Save yourself money and aggravation and avoid this place.",1.0,"Nov 11, 2015"
"The buffet had an annoyingly meager selection - assorted cheeses, some beans, potato salad that could've been purchased at your local supermarket, some fruit - and although they tell you they have 17 different kinds of meat available, we only tried about 8. Nothing of what we tried stood out in any way and especially not for the pricetag. I'll say this though: service was great. We are an annoying group to wait on, the kind that never know what they want and make waiters wait at the table while they deliberate amongst themselves, but they were patient, professional, and on-time with new rounds of meat and drinks. I was grateful for that but overall this is a lackluster place - skip and go elsewhere. Churrascaria Plataforma is a much better alternative right in Midtown.TL;DR- Food was 'meh'. Service good. Skip.",2.0,"Dec 1, 2014"
Their molten lava cake with scoop of vanilla ice cream is the definition of Foodgas em. It's been longer than I remember biting into something and thinking omg.

"This is definitely the most expensive and the worst Brazilian Steakhouse I have been to. Food was nothing special compared to the others. Service was terrible. We had a large group of 14. They brought the meat out for about 15 mins non stop and then nothing. He brought 1 pork rib to our table that looked great that i couldnt wait to try so i asked the waiter to bring more. Not only did they not bring it but they stopped serving us. We finally got fed up of waiting and had to track someone down for the check. This was the first buffet that i left not full. Im from Westchester and shouldve went to Texas De Brazil which has the same food, costs less, has much better service and much easier parking.",1.0,"Dec 24, 2018"
"Fogo de chao has always been my personal favorite whether it's this one or the one in maryland. I would agree with everyone else that it's not the cheapest and you'll probably not eat your moneys worth but that's all buffets. That doesn't stop me from coming though because of the variety of cuts they offer and it's plenty of quality meat. The service is outstanding always and it just fits the definition of a quality steakhouse. If you're in the area and feeling steak, I suggest you stop by here.",5.0,"Jun 13, 2016"

"This is hands down one of my favorite steakhouses in midtown. Very fun place with a great ambiance. It's always packed every time I walk by for the train & being ""new kids on the block"", I knew my co workers and i had to try it out. The outside makes the restaurant appear to be smaller than it is. But when you walk in, WOW, do you realize how ginormous the place is. The restaurant itself is stunning, the layout, design, architecture. There are two bars  which always seem to be packed but somehow the staff delivers drinks & food in a timely manner. My only critic would be better music! Food is amazing - even starting with the tasty Pan de Queso. Staff is friendly and engaging and everyone is welcoming. Other diners always seem to be having a great time. Fogo is thee spot to go to if you're in midtown Manhattan & looking for a cool spot & great food!",5.0,"Feb 23, 2019"
"By far the best Brazilian food in the US. I often feel like I'm far away from my home country; therefore, I turn to Fogo and their full experience. The meats are incredible, the servers are all quick on their feet, the atmosphere is perfect (not too loud). They have a large variety of exotic Brazilian food in the salad bar, and some amazing and tasteful cuts of meat. I particularly enjoy the Fraldinha due to its flavor and tenderness (you don't even need a knife to cut it!!)I go there a few times a week and if you're ever in a city with a Fogo, I'd highly recommended it.The desserts are also so delicious. I'd personally recommend the Chocolate Molten cake and the tres leches.One of the top restaurants in NY",5.0,"Feb 21, 2019"

The food was delicious, they have a huge buffet offering many salads, cold cuts, fruits, and many more. The high point of the night was the meats coming around the tables and being served at your plate. The food was flavorful, fresh, succulent, crispy. The service was immaculate, and the manager was very helpful and zealous. Another good thing worth mentioning was the drink, it was espetacular! I don't remember the name of it, but it tastes very yummy. I will surely come back to this remarkable place.",5.0,"May 4, 2019"
"Came here on a Sunday night with friends. No wait time since we made a reservation. We get seated very quickly and the waiter/waitress was very patient and nice. She hands out a round card which is the main role for "" I want food"" sign. We started with the salad bar, it serves fresh veggie/fruits and cold dishes.

"Bursting Stomach, Empty Wallet, Worth ItFood: 4.75 StarsI don't recall the name of the majority of meats outside of the filet mignon, but my only recommendation would be to try one of everything. Pace yourself, begin digesting the first slices of the beautiful cuts of meat then start anew. Don't be intimidated by the quantity of meats making their rounds in the dining area. Don't forget to taste the sides and consume at least one plate of each dish, or 4-5 dishes of the polenta (my recommendation). You will be stuffed by the end of the meal, but you' will also be surprised at the fact your body is able to handle so much food. Taste everything, if it is too much share with your fellow diners. Absorb as much of the experience as possible. I sound like a broken record, but Fogo de Chao is a restaurant most people won't be visiting on a yearly basis. Enjoy it now!The only meat that I found to be subpar was the chicken. The reason being the chicken was too dry for my taste.I didn't even touch the salad bar. I forgot about its existence once I saw the meat circling around the tables. Everything is fresh, the mozzarella looked delicious. For private parties it looks as though they have an open bar cart style of handling those events. The variety of alcohols and designs of the bottles almost makes one want to hold a party for themselves and enjoy all the alcohol on their own. Service: 5 StarsHave a special request? Want tea with honey? Want former mayor Rudy Giuliani to sing Happy Birthday to you? Ok maybe the last one is a bit of a stretch. The service goes about and beyond in what they need to do to provide the diners with the best experience possible. Giving proper instructions on the tong utensils, asking what temperature you want, knowing which sections of the meat are particular temperatures. Everyone is well trained and show their professionalism at all times. Your table is carefully watched and if your sides are almost gone they are quickly replaced with fresh, warm ones.Watching the hostess at the front communicate with the other individuals working at Fogo de Chao is interesting. They communicated through walkie-talkie during my visit.Ambiance: 4.5 StarsFrom the entrance you wouldn't be able to tell, but the restaurant is gigantic. From the main entrance overlooking the main dining area to the back room for larger parties you could get lost without the proper direction (maybe I am exaggerating a little). Everything is upscale. Even though there is no real mention of proper attire, I recommend a slightly dressier style of clothing. I feel a t-shirt and shorts wouldn't cut it in this restaurant with such an upscale/trendy atmosphere. I saw two men in Rangers jerseys while eating there, so don't entirely follow my opinion. I do not recall how noisy the restaurant was, the experience drowns out the background noise.Overall (Recommendations): 4.75 StarsFood & Service are spectacular.If you enjoy meat especially at the medium rare and medium temperatures I highly recommend.Expect a bill of approximately $100 per person with tax/tip/drinks/dessert.Come hungry to fully enjoy the meal.DO NOT feel obligated to take a piece of every meat that comes by your table. If you want to slow down it is ok to say no. It will come around again.Relax, take it all in, the environment will allow you to.The dessert is a must have.**Note** If you like your cuts of meat cooked above medium, don't bother. You will not enjoy the value, flavor, texture and everything else the meat can provide you. I might sound like a schmuck here, but it is my honest opinion (and many meat connoisseurs would likely agree).",5.0,"Jun 15, 2015"
"honestly the shittiest restaurant i've been to in a while. the staff was absolutely terrible except for a few people. Food was okay but def not worth the money you're paying on a Saturday night. We went with the full churrasco experience which wasn't even full. They had seated us under the steps away from the center aisle so the staff that walks around with the rods barely made it over to us. We probably had like 3 kinds of meat for the hour or so that we were there. Even after making eye contact with multiple staff, they still didn't make their way over. Don't think we'll be coming back.",1.0,"Feb 18, 2019"
"Fogo de Chao was an ""OK"" experience, but a bit overrated and overpriced.  Texas de Brazil in Yonkers has better overall seasoning in my opinion.

If you're willing to travel, better taste, ambiance and overall experience is available.",3.0,"Feb 18, 2019"
"This is my new favorite churrascaria.  The steak was outstanding and the best part was that the meat kept coming.  Some places hold out to bring the ""specialty steak"".  Not Fogo.  Everything was super tasty but I mostly ate the cuts I like best.  So, I really can't speak to chicken or lamb.  I had the sirloin, the ribeye, the beef ribs and all were nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. I'm taking away one star because the arrugula looked like it was on its last leg.  I'm wondering if it was just for decoration for a dish on the salad bar but I don't think so.  Decor was very pretty and the service was excellent.  I would definitely come back to Fogo.

The manager & staff worked closely with my husband to make sure everything went according to plan & exactly the way he wanted It for my special day. We had chicken, garlic steak, lamb, filet mignon, & mashed potatoes. I've had mashed potatoes before from many different restaurants however the mash from here are to die for!

"A beautiful restaurant, good service and alright food. The experience is similar to other brazilian steakhouses where the gazpachos come around and shave of meat from their skewers - great experience. This chain, is of course, more expensive in nyc. $62 for the dinner (all you can eat brazilian meats, and salad bar).  In light of that price, i dont think it is worth it. After your first 2-3 meats everything ends up tasting the same. I feel that most steakhouses in nyc will provide a better meal than fogo for similar price. Some specifics: We waited a long time for the filet mignon wrapped in bacon but it never came. We ended up asking for it. We noted that after he served us he b-lined right back to the kitchen.... Are they hiding this entree?The bread is great, as are the plantains. The salad bar didn't have much to write home about. The sirloins were good, but once again everything started tasting the same near the end of the meal. What happened to the chocolate at the end of the dinner?",3.0,"Jun 19, 2016"
Was here for restaurant week and the place was packed. I had a reservation for 7:45 but was not seated until 8:15.  The waiter tried to sell and guilt us on having their regular priced per head and looked annoyed when he realized we weren't going to be guilted into it.  We never saw the waiter until the end of the meal when we asked for the check.Food was pretty average aside from the Picanha.  The garlic steak was extremely overcooked and the so-called sides that were supposed to be abundant were nowhere to be found.If you hate doing restaurant week and want to treat customers like crap then don't do the promotion.  I would never go back.,2.0,"Sep 7, 2018"
"The restaurant is located in a real upscale part of Manhattan; Rockerfeller Center. Soon as you walk in, the place is extremely elegant. Youre introduced to beautiful decor as you walk down the staircase. Immediately, what stood out was the extensive collection of wine. You dont have to be a wine connoisseur to be impressed.     To start off, my friend and I grabed a bunch of stuff from the buffet: white rice, black beans, fresh mozarella, potato salad, etc. Nothing from the buffet dissapointed, except for the onions in the potato salad. Our waitress brought us the complimentary cheese bread, caramelized bananas, and garlic mashed potatoes. All of that was delicious.     Then the meats come out. These guys just keep coming and coming at you. Just when youre about to try 1 meat, another dude pops out of nowhere asking you if you want some of what he has. All sorts of steak cuts, lamb, chicken, pork, ribs. Some of the meats were a little too salty, but I've got to say that nothing was disgusting when it came to flavor. The cut that really stood out was the garlic steak. Wow!!!! I couldnt get enough of it. 1 time I even sent my waitress and a manager to go look for the guy who was carrying that steak cut. Theres no way you can leave this place with an empty stomach.     Afterwards, comes the dessert. Rather than give you a menu or list, they actually bring out a presentation of all the desserts; each in a seperate plate. Everything looks delicious, its hard to choose just 1. My friend decided he wanted the flan. It was too sweet for him. I tried some of it; it was no different than the average flan. My dessert on the other hand....GOSTOSO!!!!! The second best tasting Tres Leche cake I've ever had. Wanted to order another one, but I would probably need a shot of insulin later on.     Overall, the food was great, the atmosphere was oppulent, and the service was fascinating. Big shout out to our waitress René. The only reason I wont give this place 5 stars is because it doesnt have as many meats as Texas De Brazil. Nevertheless, I recommend this place for a date. I would definately return another day",4.0,"Nov 8, 2015"

"I was excited when I received an invite to this up scale Brazilian barbeque especially being a semi recovering addict of meat down the gullet syndrome (I'm lying like a rug, I love all things meat, shhh I know I'm setting myself up with that statement).  This guy was not disappointed.Oh, the unmistakeable primal urge to rip and tear all forms of beef, pork, lamb and chicken without having to kill and skin then cook it, they do it for you. Sometimes I awake in the middle of the night with meat on my mind with a stash of beef jerky or pepperoni where only I can find in the depths of the refrigerator or cupboard up high, but I digress. If a smorgasbord of endless all you can eat meat on skewers appeals to you, then here you go.I've been to other Brazilian BBQ's in the past, but not like this. First off an unbelievably fresh and quite large salad bar with slices of sandwich type  meat like prosciutto & soppressata, cheese's, roasted veggies like eggplant and zucchini, variety of super hot peppers and of course all types of salad options. I had to force myself to a limit of 1 & 1/2 plates so there would be room for the barrage of protein I was about to encounter.They have a very unique system to let the server's know when to offer and when to by pass you. You receive a coaster that is green for yes filler up and the other side is red for taking a breather. You have to know I saw only green, baby. Now the variety being offered up is as vast as the ceiling is high, you won't feel cramped with these super high cathedral like ceiling in the dining room, that's for sure. Seasoned and cooked to perfection. Every cut of beef known to man, so it seemed, it's hard to remember what you devoured last because they keep coming like waves in the ocean. I always ask for a lil bit of fat slightly burnt with my slice of marbleized wonderfullnes. Lamb that melted in my mouth may have been my favorite, but as I said it's difficult to tell with skewer after skewer filling my plate until it runneth over into my tum tum. So I apologize for not describing the options in greater detail, but this is one of those places you'll have to experience for yourself.Service is impeccable. They not only delivered mouth watering descriptions per item that would make Gordan Ramsey proud, but paid close attention to your beverage needs. Remarkably decadent for a undoubtedly coma laden meat fest.A bit pricey around $70ish depending on choice drinks per person, but in the heart of NYC what would you expect. Impressive wine list. The mixologists keep top shelf cocktails flowing, tonight the ""Old Fashion's"" kept me comfy.Come hungry and leave adjusting one more notch on the belt for breathing room. Viva!",4.0,"May 20, 2015"
"This used to be my favorite steakhouse ever since I first went to the Chicago location over 10 years ago. Being that I've been to over 10 of their locations, I have to say the service here is the worst by far. There were only two of us so we got put by a side table. One of us ordered the panseared salmon which took one hour and five minutes to come out. And when it came out it was as dry as a rock. About 45 minutes and we asked the waiter about the order and he had no idea we had ordered it. About 15 minutes then we got some cold bread and lukewarm mashed potatoes and lukewarm side dishes. The Salad bar was OK But it is generally much better in there Baltimore or Chicago locations. For a steakhouse, It boggles my mind how their best cut has become the lamb. Most of the beef is simply of inferior Quality and not what it used to be. Finally for dessert we had the tres leches cake which was incredibly good. Overall Going into this place one knows that they are not going to get USDA prime beef and people go more so for the experience. However when the service is slow and being at a side table you feel ignored for the two hours you spend there, I'd rather go somewhere else next time.",3.0,"Jan 26, 2019"
"I've been waiting to try this location for quite some time. When I heard it was available on RW I made sure I signed up the first day reservations were open on Opentable. Also happened to reserve for the first day of RW. I digress. Brazilian bbq buffet in NYC - what a treat. I don't even want to talk about the normal prices for this place - I paid RW dinner prices and it was delicious.I made a resie at 8pm but we still had to wait like 10/15 minutes. Guess it's hard to gauge sitting time in a buffet. The decor is really up-class high-class. When you get seated, you're greeted by your waiter/waitress explaining the ""red/green"" 'coaster.' Red means 'don't give meat.' Green means 'meat please.' They have a great, beautifully set up salad bar. There is rice on one side, and an island of delicious appetizers. Some highlights include: prosciutto, salami, cheese, smoked salmon, sliced tomatoes, jalapenos, onions, etc. they have salad, greens, vegetables and cheeses. It all is very good.Now onto the meat.. I don't remember everything but I will try my best to remember. Also, in my defense, it was dark lighting inside so my memory is a bit hazy. Also in my defense, the people serving the meat are all of ethnic background, have an accent and spoke softly so it was double trouble hard to hear. Chicken wing - great start huh? Pay top dollar for chicken wings. Just kidding - the chicken wing was my first item and i just remember it was one of the most tender pieces of chicken I've had, with a salty, crisp chicken skin. Linguica - pork sausage. Not a fan - not much more to say than thatLombo - pork loin encrusted with Parmesan cheese. Maybe you'll like it but I didn't. Encrusted may be an understatement to the amount of cheese on it. I remember it being dry as well - pork loin may have been tender? But the cheese made it really dry.Frango - chicken breasts wrapped in bacon. I love this but the chicken was dry. Bacon is bacon so enough said.Cordeiro - lamb. It was very good. Very gamey though aka venison. A very strong taste. The piece I had was tender.Costela de Porco - pork ribs seasoned and cooked. Very good. I only had one piece but couldn't complain.Alcatra - top sirloin. Amazing. Just amazing. Medium rare, well seasoned, tender, almost filet mignon texture.Picanha - top sirloin. Amazing. Just amazing. Medium rare, well seasoned, tender, almost filet mignon texture. LOL you just read the same description twice. I like this one better though. The outside layer had some seasoning and was cooked with a slight crisp.I think that's everything. If not, oh well. All you need to do is turn your coaster thing to green and say yes to everything. Warning, you may become overwhelmed by the amount of meat that comes your way but is that really a warning and is that really a problem? Nevertheless, this was a great experience and I will probably be coming here again for RW.Oh! And the fogo malbec wine was on point. Girlfriend got a moscato wine.",4.0,"Jul 27, 2015"
"Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday. If you want an endless meat paradise, then you've found your spot. You have your little coaster sized signal to let the servers know if you want more or if you need a break. If you need a break from the meat, they also have a cold bar with salads, veggies, smoked salmon, etc. Then when you think you're done, they bring out a glorious tray of desserts.

"I messed up. I booked a lunch reservation for two, thinking it was RW. It was not. Shame, shame -- especially as I feel that what I paid for today definitely was not worth the triple-digit bill.Salad/appetizer buffet was beautifully set up (shout-out to the candied bacon that was probably my favorite item on offer at Fogo de Chao [v sad]). Servers who came around with the meats were a little brusque, but whatever, they were busy with the four other tables with diners of 3 each, right? Such a demanding time for them, obviously.The meats were way over-salty, particularly for the filet mignon and the lamb chops, sometimes. Their standard for medium and medium rare did fluctuate in between rounds, with some medium rare options being super bloody and sometimes just pink. Pretty sure I tried most everything worth trying (aka the beef and lamb bc pork and chicken are just a waste of valuable tummy real estate). One server in particular, a young-ish man, was really quite attentive and sweet, so he deserves recognition for his hard work (Katherine, on the other hand, left a tad much to be desired). Beware: the meat is VERY fatty and you'll end up leaving huge chunks of fat/gristle/other unsavory parts of your portion on your plate. Also, I was a bit taken aback at how dessert wasn't included. Somehow, I merely assumed that ti would be included, most likely due to my previous familiarity with the Restaurant Week menu. Long story short, i'ts not included: and my sister's tres leche cake was $11.25 while my chocolate mousse was $11.  For those of you familiar with the venerable Cheesecake Factory, a slice of cake there is around $7-8. Go to the Cheesecake Factory.

Then we asked if they had chicken hearts or skirt steak because they weren't part of the rodizzio menu and they brought it out to us. Everyone and everything is above and beyond our expectations.They give you a several different appetizers such as cheese bread, sweet plantains, mashed potatoes and some type of corn cake. Everything was good and it was never empty! As you were going to finish the plate, they bring another one out before the plate is empty.The food was absolutely amazing and the salad bar has a little of everything. Our drinks were delicious! I had the superfruit lemonade (alcoholic) and there was real strawberry purée And blueberries! We also had red wine sangria and that was the best sangria that I've had! And our water glasses were NEVER empty!For dessert, we had flan and tres leches cake. The flan is thicker than usual, but that's common with Brazilian style flan. It was very delicious as was the tres leches cake. I can go on and on..if I can give this place 10 stars, I would! Oh! They also have a coat check! I'm sooooo glad there is one opening much closer to home. Can't wait to go back.  It was worth every penny of our expensive bill!",5.0,"Feb 21, 2014"
They walk around with the meat so it's barely warm. I really wanted to like it but it was a let down.,2.0,"Aug 2, 2018"
"I came here for a birthday celebration and I was impressed. I'd never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and it's always been on my bucket list since I'm a meat lover. The decor was gorgeous with dark wood and sultry lighting which really set the tone for the evening. There was a little wait since we went for dinner on a Saturday but our group had a few drinks at the bar to kill some time. I had the caipiriña,the boys had JW black and ginger, some of the girls had a peach and champagne drink - each of them were reasonably priced and delicious. My caipiriña was my favorite since I love limes. We were taken downstairs to the dining hall to get our dinner started. The salad bar had a wide variety but it wasn't as large as I was hoping for. My favorite items here were the cheese, grilled portobellos, caprese salad and cured meats. After all of that, it was time to get started on our meat fest. Every single cut of beef was delicious! I especially loved the garlic sirloin (juicy and salty goodness), the filet mignon (of course!!), bacon wrapped filet, lamb chops and bacon wrapped chicken. The sides were good, we mostly ate the mashed potatoes and I think the rest went untouched. After dinner, we had one of everything from the dessert menu and our favorites were tiramisu and the chocolate cake. Overall, this is a solid place for people who can really put it down at dinnertime. I literally ate hundreds of dollars of meat for around $60. Be careful with the drinks though, since they add up - especially if you like to do celebratory shots like my group.",4.0,"Apr 22, 2015"
"Have been to a couple different Fogo's in different states, and I must say that their quality of food, and service is ALWAYS exceptional.  My favorite's are the Filet Mignon, the House Steak, and the tri-tip. Seasoned well, prepared awesome and tastes amazing. In case you do not know, this is primarily an ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT style restaurant.  They do offer a salad bar, but I never bother because I save my stomach space for the various protein choices that are being served. If you haven't experienced a Brazilian Steakhouse before, I would really suggest that you stop at a Fogo and try it out.  You will not be disappointed at all. It is a little bit on the expensive side, so, if you are a meat eater, then it is worth it...if you are not, or are a light eater, then you may want to try some of the restaurants' other dining options.  Either way, you will love it. Enjoy!",5.0,"Sep 22, 2017"
Love love love this place. We were taken aback by the address after having been to an old location on 3rd Ave. honestly I think I enjoyed this layout better. Elegant but not stuffy. All the staff are friendly. The meats were so fresh and came out like clock work. The buffet was fresh and fabulous as well. The market sides were also delicious! The mashed potato and the house special rib eye were my favsss! I can't wait to go back. Definitely an occasion place but would have it on the top of my list for restaurant week!! Make sure to have an empty stomach! So much food!,5.0,"Sep 22, 2017"
If you are a devoted meat lover and appreciate enjoying a good variety of meat over wine-this is definitely the place for you. They also have a salad bar where you can get your needed vitamins and nutrients to have a balanced diet. I adore the interior design of this place: high ceiling with the right amount of light to set the mood for a relaxing evening out with your friends. Would definitely take my parents to here next time! : ),5.0,"Mar 27, 2016"
Ive been to this place 3 times and im planning my fourth ... great place to chill out if you are a meat lover... and they do big parties ... if you are not sure what a Brazilian steak house is ... quick break down alllllll youuuuu cannnnn eat meat... there's a small salad bar to help compliment the steak you eat... very nice interior decorations and very nice staff,5.0,"Jul 30, 2018"
"This is such a cool experience. It was my first time at a Brazillian steakhouse and I was impressed! We went on a Thursday evening around 5:30 and it was pleasantly quiet. Only a few groups. The restaurant is very open and has a nice feel. All the steaks were delicious! They chicken couldn't compare, in my opinion but the steaks blew me away! Can't wait to go back again someday. Beware- refills aren't free and if you ask for sparking water they will just bring you an entire bottle.",5.0,"Apr 15, 2016"

"It was my son's 30th birthday and this was his choice for a Sunday brunch celebration. He and his wife had been there before and they loved it and wanted to return. I don't eat red meat so was really not looking forward to dining here. Well I was so pleasantly surprised... it was absolutely wonderful. Our waiter Chris could not have been more attentive and when I told him I did not eat red meat, 3 different kinds of chicken were brought to me, all delicious. Everything was wonderful and the icing on the cake so to speak was a piece of cake gratis packed to carry away for his birthday. Extreme kudos and accolades to all at Fogo de Chao for a delightful as well as delicious dining experience.",5.0,"Nov 12, 2017"
"Extremely disappointed. Been to about a dozen Brazilian steakhouses. The food is average. The service is terrible. I went with a group of 14. We all had the same all you can eat deal for $70. For the first 15 minutes the meat did not stop flowing. Then it stopped entirely, with of us showing green. My buddy ordered the same soda several times and never got one.After about 15-20 minutes of not being served, a server walked in with a rack. Looked at us and walked out.(we were in a separated room. The 14 of us literally had to yell at the guy and intimidate him to serve us. After that round we never got served again. I left hungry. Several items like the ribs and garlic pork never even made it to our table.The meat was poorly seasoned. The salad bar was decent though. The only diligent employee was the guy who refilled the water. The bill was over $1200 and we all felt conned. The only saving grace was the good times we had talking and reminiscing.When it comes to Brazilian steakhouses, stick with Plataforma on 49th, or Texas De Brazil. #NeverGoingBack #WontGetFooledAgain",1.0,"Dec 22, 2018"
For anyone who loves meat this is the place to be. They have plenty of choices. A huge salad bar. Worth the money if you can eat a lot. We barely made a dent in the price we didn't eat very much. But for what we ate it was so well worth it. The meats were spice and roasted to perfection.,5.0,"Jul 20, 2018"
"My boyfriend and I came in for restaurant week and we had the best meal. They have a little salad bar along with a bar with cheeses and meats. We ordered a bottle of wine and my boyfriend got super drunk, he's a lightweight. We were celebrating our anniversary and I think there was a groupon for here. It was supposed to be 40$ a meal but apparently, we were supposed to show them the groupon initially, I did not know. So they charged me the 40$ but because it was groupon it was supposed to be a limited amount of types of meat they were supposed to serve us. But the waiter was so nice, they let us use the 40$ coupon even though we ate all the different types of meats they had. The servers were very on point and always kept our plates full. There was never a moment where my plate was empty. The meats were extremely juicy and not dry at all. Def a great place for special occasions!",5.0,"Mar 13, 2018"

"So disappointed at this restaurant. I came here two years ago with my friends and I absolutely loved it. However, when I came here again a few days ago, I decided that I will probably never come back. I heard that Fogo de Chão was participating in Restaurant Week (RW) and my boyfriend loves meat so I thought that this would be the perfect place to take him. I called two days before my actual reservation date to ask some questions and to reserve our spot. I originally wanted to go on Saturday but was told that the RW menu was only available on Mondays-Fridays. However, the lady on the phone informed me about their Best of Brazil menu, which was available during dinner times. She also informed me that it was $39, a few dollars cheaper than RW. Since I wanted to go on Saturday anyways, this sounded perfect for me. I asked her what was the difference between the Best of Brazil menu and the RW menu and she literally said, ""not much"" so I took that as a good sign since we would basically be getting the RW menu. Just note that the RW menu and the Best of Brazil menu does not include meat cuts!I informed my friend of this deal and she started questioning all of the information that I gave her because $39 seemed too good to be true. Thus, I called again (same day) to confirm that dinner was $39 and another lady said yes. On the actual day of my reservation, I called ONCE AGAIN to confirm that the Best of Brazil menu was $39 because I did not want to pay an additional $20+ when I could easily go during RW for $42. The person that I spoke to on the phone confirmed yes. So, I happily went along with my boyfriend during our reserved time. My boyfriend and I had a very light lunch in anticipation for our big dinner. If you're hungry, the food generally tastes better, right? Not for Fogo De Chão! Maybe my taste buds changed over the years but I thought the quality of the cuts of meat were just average and way too salty. I found myself drinking a lot of water and eating items from the salad bar to cleanse my palate because of how salty the meat was. I honestly think that my boyfriend could make better steak. On the bright side, I loved their salad bar. They have a delicious homemade vinaigrette that everyone should try! Also ask for their chimichurri sauce. It helps bring out more flavor in the meat. In terms of service, the meat carvers took a while to come to our table at times. We didn't mind it too much since we were not in a rush. The waitress also barely came to refill our water, but that was also not that big of a deal to us since they give you a huge glass to begin with. Now, here comes the worst part of the night. We ask for the check and are charged the full price of $63.95 per person. You can probably envision my confusion as I literally asked three different people on two different days if my reservation was $39 pp. I thought that maybe I was charged more because I didn't finish a few scraps of meat? But nope. I asked the waiter to clarify as to why I was charged that price and she said it was because I had the full experience. I told her that I asked people over the phone and confirmed that it was $39 pp and she tells me that that price is for lunch only. I knew that was wrong because the lady over the phone clearly said it's for dinner and on Facebook, it also says it's for dinner. The waitress seemed kind of annoyed at what I was telling her so she brings a manager over. The manager came and asked me what happened and I explained to him everything that I was told via my three phone calls and the promotion on Facebook. He then asks me to show him the Facebook promotion, so I did (I thought this was kind of rude because it felt like he didn't believe me, but oh well). He then proceeded to tell me that I had to tell the waitress in the beginning that I was here for the Best of Brazil menu and that I had the full experience, hence the full price. I take the full blame for not mentioning it in advance because I didn't know. However, I wish that one of the three people that I spoke to over the phone explained that to me so I could have done that. Maybe it was something that I should have known? I don't know. But if you're interested in the Best of Brazil menu, TELL THEM IN ADVANCE when you get seated! Fortunately, the manager told me that he would change the price to $39 pp so I paid about $100 for two people (thank you to the manager who changed the price!). I did really appreciate that the manager was understanding of the situation towards the end.$100 or $200, I don't think I would come back here solely because the meat was way too salty and mediocre. But if you like really salty meat and want unlimited amounts of it, then Fogo de Chão may be the place for you!",2.0,"Aug 7, 2017"
"This place is beautiful and the service is excellent. I'm not a huge meat fan but still found this place nice to eat. We went out on a group date night with 3 other married couples. I'm breastfeeding and wanted everything well done (even when I'm not I still have my meat cooked well done) you just let them know and they will only give you meats that are cooked throughly. Some meats were tastier than others. The fruit was fresh which my husband and I had a lot of. The kale salad was great. The white rice and black bean sauce was good. We all were full because it's all you can eat. You can easily get overwhelmed because they come around every 5 seconds with a new meat. Overall I had a great time and the food wasn't that bad. The price for four couples was $200 per couple. Definitely very expensive, not so sure it was entirely worth that price.",3.0,"Jul 8, 2018"

Happy Hour menu was great, now the bread is hard and stale, chicken is cold, salad is wilted. The service has down the hill massively as well, it seems like there was a change in management and style. The only people that keep us coming back are Angie and Angela, who have been consistently great. They go above and beyond to compensate for the other shortcomings. Also, a note to the managers, fix the ladies' bathroom, one sink faucet just dangles, another barely functions, and on a lucky day the soap dispenser works.",3.0,"Nov 29, 2018"

"Extremely horrendous and distasteful  experience. Reservations were made for 645pm. My family arrived at 6.18pm and was told to come check back in when the time was closer. My spouse checked back in at 630 and was told to come back. Now it's a couple minutes past 645 and I see parties being seated who just walked in.. I walk up about 647 and was told that it was a partial check in which is why we weren't being seated. When I questioned the three girls competence and the purpose of a reservation, it was like speaking to a deer in headlights. I figured this wasn't going anywhere so I asked to speak to a manager. Richardo oliveira, general manager, walks up and I tell him my issue with his check in team hoping he would empathize since he's a manager and in the service business. Nope, he was cold, dismissive, and worse wanted to invite us back as his guest? Seriously, you dismiss my concerns and say things like ""it's thanksgiving, we're behind, it's only 6 minutes after your reservation"". The concerns that you have as a manager does not concern me as a consumer. The least you could've done was acknowledge my disappointment, apologize, and been a little more sincere but instead you ruined my thanksgiving.

"I was not impress at all- I didn't get the meat that I wanted. You'll have to ask for the premium meat considering I paid for the dinner option and yes I read the restaurant week. I made sure it wasn't - having said that I expected all premium meats will be going. Around as much as the sausage, checkin break and cheap meats. Somehow when it came to fillet mig on, rib eye and other premium items either you have the balls to ask or wait around till they fill you up with the cheap meats. Service was nice but I didn't pay premium $$ for a freaking chicken breast. Yes we were on a group of 7-  never again for the amount of cash we paid.",5.0,"Jun 18, 2018"

"Could've been wayyy better. Their food is overall OK but the whole point of Brazilian STEAKhouses are the meat, obviously. Only one kind of meat I had was actually really good and the rest all tasted similar and had a bunch of fat on them that was impossible to chew. Their sides are good but the whole point is the meat! They're also too pricey for food that isn't great. We could have gone to a legit steakhouse for the same price for amazing food. Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars was because I liked the ambiance and mostly the sides. Do not go here if you know what good quality meat is.",2.0,"Jan 31, 2018"
"The food is worthy of 5 stars. The service is 2 stars at best. I've been to fogo in LA and Atlanta, but NY was definitely the least impressive. Food: My only unique advice is to request the beef rib. It's not on the menu and they don't bring it around often. I didn't see it until I asked for it. It's literally a cow's rib on a massive cutting board. Not one of those vertical skewers they carry around. You'll thank me. Service: We had a party of 4 on a Saturday night. We get seated and the table we're seated at is really wobbly. I ask to to have it fixed so the waiter crawls under the table and lifts the legs on one side of the table so high that our water starts spilling. He then stands up and walks away. Thanks bud. Then I order a bottle of wine. Waiter returns and says it's out of stock. Then I order another bottle of wine. Waiter returns and says it's out of stock. Then I order another bottle of wine. Waiter returns and says it's out of stock. 3 times! Then this manager dude walks over and asks what I'm looking for in my wine. I say a reasonably priced cab or malbec. He gets annoyed and says he has lots of red wine choices he can walk me through. I tell him it's fine, we don't need wine. He leaves. Then another manager comes over and asks if she can help with wine. I tell her I want a bottle of red under $50 and she literally scoffs and says ""yea, that's not going to happen.""

"My family and I were very excited to try this restaurant since we are big fans of Texas de Brazil, however, Fogo de Chao was a huge disappointment and we will never return. First, within minutes of being seated my son felt something wet on his back. We looked up and noticed drops of water falling from the ceiling, it appeared to be air condition condensation. We were promptly moved to another table and ordered drinks with our server; wine for my husband and me, 2 Shirley Temples for my kids. The server disappeared so we placed another drink order with another server. Our wine arrived but the Shirley Temples did not for the rest of the meal even though we kept asking our server about them. Then my son asked for ketchup with his meal, which also did not appear until we finally asked the 5th server. The service was the worst I have ever seen at a Manhattan restaurant. I continue... the meat that was sent out was low-quality, like sausage, pork or chicken. We told our server, as well as all the gauchos (the guys serving the meat), that we like rare red meat but none came out for another 15 minutes, everything was medium-well done up to that point. A manager came over to see how our meal was going and we told him we were waiting all night for the filet mignon and lamb chops but have yet to see them even though we asked our server several times. Then finally we started to see rare meat come out which was just OK tasting and had a chalky texture (the obvious sign of poor-quality meat). Also, ALL the meats are overly salted, to the point that you cannot eat much of it. Towards the end of our meal, we finally were served the filet mignon and the lamb chops but we couldn't eat much of it because by that point we weren't very hungry anymore.  This is all part of their master plan: mediocre, overly-salted meat, cooked too much, with poor service and they wait for the end of the meal to send out the good cuts of meat. It was a very disappointing experience. Going forward, the only churrascaria we will ever eat at again is Texas de Brazil. There is simply no comparison.",1.0,"Jun 22, 2017"

There's also an open side bar with salad toppings and fruits. Unfortunately my stomach can't handle eating that much food but it's truly worth it if you can!

"Came for restaurant week on our anniversary  for 38$  we always wanted to try it so why not. Salad bar is all you can eat but it was mediocre I only recommend the fresh mozzarella and potato salad. The cheese bread was great and the sides for the table were ok polenta, mash and the sweet plantains. Now for the real stuff I'm a big meat eater so the quality really affected my experience. All of the meats came right off the grill which was great but so overly seasoned  and super salty. They were trying to hide the fact that the quality of the meat wasn't great. The  picanha was my favorite for now. The dessert was meh cheesecake and chocolate cake. The real issue was when I got home I have never felt sick after eating a meal and oh I felt like crap. I ended up throwing up and drinking a ton of water. I know my sodium intake was wayyyy to high. My bf also woke up in the middle of the night super thirsty. So be prepared to be super thirsty because of all that salt.

"First round of meat, excellent. 5 stars all the way. When I turned my card green they filled the plate rapid fire. Maybe because we were there a bit early and the servers needed something to do, maybe they wanted us to fill up quickly, whatever the rationale- we got the meat.  Everyone asked how we liked it prepared, and as I am a rare meat fan I found everything perfect.However, round 2 was less than stellar. It seemed like the cheaper meats came around more frequently, and gone was the asking for temperature. The second round meats were all overcooked, to the point my jaw started to hurt from chewing overcooked meat. I felt bad seeing how much had to be cleared because it was simply inedible. We went for our anniversary after a Broadway show,  When we booked, it asked me if we were celebrating and I wrote ""anniversary.""  I saw a few plates that said ""Happy Anniversary"" written on them for dessert, so despite being stuffed with meat went ahead and ordered. No happy anniversary on the plate.Last thing, as soon as we sat down we got hit up for a pineapple rum drink.  It came with a huge block of ice, and not a lot of drink.  It was off-menu and 13$ a glass, which we only discovered at the end we we saw the bill.  Could have skipped that and dessert and saved myself ~30$.",2.0,"Sep 8, 2015"
Great Brazilian Steakhouse with Great Selection on the Buffet from Cheese to cold Salad and even crispy Bacon!!!Love the Hearts of Palm and olives...The Lamb is off the hook as well as the sirloin and all meats are seasoned well and come juicy and temperature correctly!Came here twice and will continue as the price to quality is worth every penny!!!Come hungry and don't eat too much of the Cheese-bread...

"This review is strictly for the bar/happy hour. I come here all the time after work as the happy hour special is good as is the food offered. But the service is just atrocious. The bartenders have no idea what is going on, forget orders all the time, are not attentive to refilling your drink, and not friendly AT ALL. You get the impression that they are annoyed that you are ordering off the reduced happy hour menu. So off putting.

"Fogo de Chao has been on my radar since I was a kid growing up in Puerto Rico. In this Plato's Cave, I formed my knowledge on sporadic glimpses on the mainland (not surprisingly, most of which involved food advertising). On every flight I've been on, Sky Mall (RIP) showcased the fine meats of Fogo de Chao in exotic locations like New York, San Francisco, and Omaha NE. Any request to go here would be outvoted by my parents (even as a chubby child, I did not eat enough to warrant $50 worth of meat, plus my dad is essentially a vegetarian).  So as an adult, when Restaurant Week rolled over and fellow Yelpers Alan B. and Jon B. invited me to try out this restaurant, I was keen to accept. Judging by most of the other Yelp reviews, it seems like no one comes here other than during Restaurant Week, and in this instance, I won't be the exception. Afterall, RW makes this a somewhat affordable treat; I really couldn't see myself dropping about $70 including tax and tip when I can get the same experience for $20 less. This place (a temple of meat, if you will) almost looks like an optical illusion. You rarely find large restaurants in Manhattan--Fogo is massive and modern. There is so much food here, it's hard to keep track. Everything was good, some things were particularly outstanding. FdC is a well oiled machine. Considering how busy they were on a Thursday night during RW, they were extremely efficient in seating us, getting food to our table, providing dessert, and bringing the check in shortly thereafter. I do wish the staff did a better job of explaining what each of the offering entailed. The only explanation you receive comes from menus by the entrance vaguely highlighting the RW offerings. I'd like to know what the picanha is, for example, and how it's seasoned and cooked. The servers just give you a one word explanation of what they bring over. Alright, on to the food. Pan de queso is a memorable Brazilian treat. I can't vouch for how FdC makes it, but it's usually gluten free, as it's cooked with tapioca flour. Don't fill up on it, but do use it to soak up the au jus from the meat (the servers are happy to provide you with some from their trays if you ask). What was outstanding: the skirt steak and one of the lamb dishes. The skirt steak's flavor was enhanced with enough garlic, salt, and pepper to let the cut shine. I have no idea what the lamb dish was called, or how it was seasoned (see paragraph above), but it's one of the best lambs I've tasted. Honorable mentions to the chicken legs wrapped in bacon (juicy and tender), as well as the parmesan crusted pork (also tender, and a good concept overall). I wasn't impressed with the restaurant's ""signature cut"" of prime rib. It was too dry for my taste. None of the side dishes manages to steal the show, so make sure you don't get full on those. The RW offerings included dessert: a choice of cheesecake, chocolate moose, or key lime pie. I chose the latter, as it's one of my favorite desserts. It was decent at best here; while I liked the fresh whipped cream, the graham crackers had an odd aftertaste of chocolate. I'm going to file Fogo de Chao under my ""been there, done that"" category. You come here for the experience, after all. Having sampled pretty much the restaurant has to offer, I would rather pay individually for the lamb, parmesan pork, and the skirt steak. I really just wish I knew what that lamb dish was called, I'm going to be dreaming about it for a while...",5.0,"Jul 8, 2018"

"This place gets a 4.5. I honestly had minimal complaints about Fogo. I've been trying to come to this restaurant a number of times but always end up canceling because something comes up. I finally got to try it and was not disappointed. The restaurant itself is huge - multi-floors with the primary seating on the lower level. I came here for restaurant week on a Friday night with reservations made in advanced. We were seated towards the very back of the restaurant. For those who are not familiar with Brazilian steakhouses, they have servers walking around with different cuts of meats and you can choose whether or not you want. If you get full, you have a coaster on your table with green on one side and red on the other. If you're stuffed and need a break, flip the coaster on the red side. If you're still hungry, keep your coaster on the green side! I would say that the meat servers were super attentive and polite. Sitting in the very back of the restaurant had its cons because we felt like our waitress was not as attentive. The cold bar buffet was enormous. Your choice of cold meats, cheeses, salads, roasted veggies, etc. For side dishes, we were also served yuka fries, mashed potatoes and cheesy bread. For dessert, you have your choice of cheesecake or chocolate cake. We left the restaurant completely stuffed!",3.0,"Apr 28, 2015"
"Came here for Restaurant Week Summer 2015 and it was delicious. You have your pick of the salad bar which has some excellent cheese, smoked salmon and salad dressings. The real joy is the meat, which comes to you round the clock as long as your green coaster is up. The bottom sirloin was my favorite, but their house special steak was incredible as well.  They don't serve the filet as part of the Restaurant Week, but I've had it before and it's delicious as well.  I would say to generally avoid anything encrusted in parmesan (the chicken was particularly dry). For dessert there is a choice of cakes. I enjoyed the cheesecake, but I've definite had better. Overall for the price, this is a great deal and a great place for quality meat.",5.0,"Jul 26, 2015"

"This is a review that is long overdue. I had a company team building day and wanted to treat the executive team to a fine lunch, therefore Fogo de Chao was the choice in sunny south beach. The management team at Fogo was fantastic and reserved the wine room for our staff. Needless to say, the atmosphere is very high-end and my executive team was extremely excited at first glance of the restaurant. The entire experience was phenomenal and well priced for the caliber of food offered. Again, kudos to the entire Fogo de Chao team.The reason for finally reviewing the amazing experience at Fogo is because I returned to dine this evening with my wife and again the experience was five star. The staff is so attentive and it starts from the top as Imar, the manager on duty, has customers at the forefront of all his staff. Then the decadent food selection is more than one can ever desire. Completely amazing and cooked to your preference. Thank you to the entire team at Fogo de Chao and we will return soon :)Best always.",5.0,"Mar 16, 2016"
"The location is super, it is outside the MoMa, that is a big plus. The decor is beseeching and modern. It has various levels, huge and spacious.

You can eat all what you want. A noble joint.",4.0,"Oct 24, 2015"
"I went for my birthday celebration and made reservations to guarantee a seat. I went right when it opened and was seated immediately. I wanted a nice bottle of wine so my server was kind enough to allow me to sample 2 different types. I asked for sweet wine and their recommendations were on point! The meats were constantly coming to my table and absolutely so delicious and tender! I had to turn my card to red just so I can stop and take a breath. The salad bar had great options and plus the server brought additional sides for the table. Since it was my bday I received a complimentary desert of my choice. I was so full when I left! This restaurant is definitely a great place to go for a special occasion or hearty dinner and for everything you receive, the price is reasonable.",5.0,"Jun 30, 2018"
"Great for Brazilian food in the city, but yet again, doesn't have the same aura as true Brazilian restaurants. I find it a bit odd that they serve side dishes like mashed potatoes because 1. not quite Brazilian style of eating meat 2. it doesn't seem exactly fresh or hot. The four times I have been here always seemed a tad bit off from other Brazilian restaurants I have been to but I have yet to find a better Brazilian BBQ place.",3.0,"Mar 14, 2018"
We came in on a Tuesday after work and both bars were packed. Michael the bartender helped us secure a seat as soon as someone left and took our drink and food order right away.

"I would choose a better steak restaurant with a higher price instead of this buffet. The price is a bit high based on the quality of meat you have. It is great for a meat lover. However, for me, probably 3 pieces of meat are enough for me. It is not worthy to pay 63 dollars for a meat buffet. The good thing is that there are a lot of vegetables and fruit choices.",3.0,"Jul 29, 2017"

"Their buffet is rich, it tries to please all tastes, with a great variety in the salad bar.  The hot food is a perfect sample of the traditional Brazilian food, rice, beans, yuca flower, that in a ""Brazilian barbecue"" it would be standard, so checked But the way to go in a Brazilian steak house, unless you miss home, and you have to get the rice and beans, I would go for few items of the salad bar, and keep the little coin you get when seated GREEN, so the ""Gauchos"" (Brazilian well trained in barbecue dressed in a special costume) start their catwalk with the best meats one after another and that will be by the clients choice what to choose.MUST HAVE: *PICANHA - Prime Part of the Top Sirloin; and PICANHA with Garlic. I Can't possibility describe how mouthwatering and flavorful all the experience was.

"The food here is very good and drinks are strong. A few tips:- come on the earlier side as it starts getting very crowded around 7/8pm. Service gets sloppier and slower as the evening progresses.- come prepared to eat. - don't waist too much time at the salad bar. The salads are over salty and side from the cheese and some cold cuts, there isn't much that's worth filling up on.- make sure to sample all the meats/cuts in small portions, so when you find the one you like best, you can keep asking for it. - take your time. Breaks in between are necessary so you don't get too full too quickly. This place is definitely worth the money. Highly recommended for when craving a meat feast.",4.0,"Feb 28, 2016"
"Solid 4 stars for Fogo - Came here for restaurant week (8:30 was our reservation, and they were able to seat us at 8:15 when we arrived).Ambiance: This place is MASSIVE. All (i think) tables are on the bottom floor and there is a large wine cellar on the first floor - there are massive windows so you can see all the wines. It is similar to a Boy's Club (dark wood walls, high ceilings). Food: The restaurant week menu is $40 and they offer you the same type of service as non-restaurant week - unlimited meats (when an exception of a few). Don't even bother with the salad bar - there is not a very wide selection and you should save room for the meat which will definitely fill you up. You get these cards for your table and you flip it to the green side when you want to start eating, and flip it to the red side when you're done. I ate all the meats (aside from the pork) and they were fantastic. They come over to your table and carve the meat right there - you pick how you want it cooked. They also bring you sides - plantanes, mashed potatoes, and polenta. The mashed potatoes were the best, BUT we kept asking for more and they wouldn't bring anymore! So that's a negative - if they ran out, they could have just told us instead of empty promises. For dessert, we tried the chocolate mousse and the  cheesecake. Both of which were great.Bathrooms are clean!",4.0,"Feb 19, 2015"

"If you can, wait for restaurant week.  The price is much more reasonable when you get the restaurant week menu.  The nice thing is restaurant week is almost half the price and your not losing out on much.  As far as we could tell, we don't get filet mignon, not really sure what else were excluded.  The service wasn't any different if you paid 65 per person or 38 per person.  You still get unlimited salad bar, and unlimited meats at your table.  All the Parmesan pork, bacon wrapped chicken, lamb, top sirloin, etc were all still presented to you hot and fragrant.  There is much to enjoy at this restaurant, as long as you have the stomach for it.  Come hungry, leave happy and self loathing.",5.0,"Mar 28, 2015"
"One of the better Fogo chains that I have been to. Typically the meat is dry and over cooked after a few laps of the restaurant but not here. Always fresh juicy and hot. I had a big issue with the Philly one as they served their bananas burnt after asking for new ones 3 times. Anyways, this is a great deal for a dinner to meat out on a a regular night and even better on restaurant week. The unsterile is also sick, I suggest doing a lap if you get a chance while you wait for your table. Service was always on point here and never had a bad experience.",4.0,"Nov 20, 2017"

"A nice decorated restaurant at a premium location. Right by MOMA. However it doesn't provide anything superior. Service was ok. A little bit aggressive but reasonable considering they have to check on your yes or no plaque.If not the selection of meat, I would probably give one more star. This is the 3rd Brazilian bbq I've had, the previous two offers at least 5 more styles comparing to Fogo. By the way, chicken was way too dry.The other thing is vege and fruit. Fogo has salad bar with fresh veges, but almost no fruit. I've had some great slices of beef/pork with roasted pineapple, pepper, jalapeño or so at other two bbq. It helps appetite. None seen here.Hopefully Fogo will take it as a suggestion.",3.0,"May 19, 2015"

"This was awful service and overcooked meat. I eat out frequently, and for $80/head, service should be above a chili's or fast food joint level. Dad had to ask for a waiter. 5 minutes later, a plate (they provided one plate for a table of 4.) Then I asked for a plates for the remainder of the table. As a woman eating with her family, several waiters(4) serving meat gave the men meat and walked away before asking me if I wanted any. I apologize if I was speaking to another person or chewing - I should have aggressively been staring at them! The waiter serving wine ( I ordered) asked me how the tasting  sip was, spaced out for a minute or two, and then asked me again. Why ask If you're not listening?!

"I'm probably a bit spoiled because in my home state of NJ we have a bunch of great places serving rodizio in Newark - so that's my basis for comparison.  Others have mentioned the salad bar - I'll say that it seemed fine but no serious fan of this cuisine is going to eat much at a salad bar - it's all about the meat!The meats were generally of good quality and well prepared.  I rated it 3 stars because a few of the meats were overcooked and while there were a decent number of choices there were some I'm accustomed to seeing that weren't present (skirt steak, flank steak, etc...).  Frankly, for $64.95 the selection should be dizzying!Sides were plantains, rice, beans, mashed potatoes and fried polenta.  Once again most fans of this food will limit their intake of sides but I will say that they were all good.If you have the time I'd still recommend a drive across the river to Newark where there are many better options than this chain.",3.0,"May 21, 2018"
Amazing! I am a meat lover so naturally I love Fogo. My first experience was sometime last year around the first opening at this NY location. I have frequented many times since then.

If it was a regular restaurant than okay with the buffet but it's super expensive and not convenient at all. It seems as if the owners have just stopped caring about making their restaurant better because the brand is so distinguished. It's a big restaurant, but the customers sit squished on top of one another. For the amount of money they charge they should really try a little harder to make the whole experience worth while not just rely on the name.",3.0,"Jan 15, 2018"
"Came for a birthday dinner. It's hard not to like a place whose selling point is all you can eat meat. Some of the meats were FANTASTIC. Unfortunately I can't name which ones because after a few minutes you just start discerning what you're eating based on which animal it came from. So best I can offer is there was a piece of pork which had (I'm guessing here) a lemon pepper dry rub that I thought was delicious. Also one of the many pieces of beef I tried had a great dry rub as well.I'd say my only gripe with my experience is my group ended up being seated in the far corner next to the stairs. As soon as we were being led to our table I mentioned to a friend that we were going to end up forgotten by the servers. And alas, there were stretches where we had to flag someone down to get more food. And our water glasses were never refilled-- which is rough when you're scarfing down pounds of salty meat. I wasn't as impressed with the salad bar as I thought I would be based on other reviews. But that could just be because I'm averse to vegetables. I did find some prosciutto, cheeses and smoked salmon though that were a good appetizer. Definitely not a place I'd come to often, but so glad places like this exist.

To start, the main dinning room was beautiful and quite large. I found the salad bar options uninspiring and mediocre.  Everything seemed pretty fresh but the selection was not nearly as good as other places I've been to. The highlight of the salad bar to me was the cheese and cured meat selection. The scalloped potatoes were good as well but they didn't seem to refill it. Onto the main attraction: the meat. Overall the meat was just OK.

"The quality and abundance of the meat is top notch. That said, all the meat is so heavily salted that the flavor is seriously compromised, and in some cases totally ruined. In one cut of meat, I literally found myself chewing salt crystals inside the steak. Overusing salt is a poor man's solution for adding flavor. The chefs at a restaurant of this caliber should be skilled enough to develop flavorful marinades to enhance the flavor of the meat without salting everything to death. I actually felt physically ill after my meal, with a dry mouth and dizziness as my blood pressure skyrocketed. The crazy thing is that I don't even have high blood pressure. I would love to return once this salt situation is rectified, but I never will until then.",2.0,"Jul 13, 2017"

The server cuts the meat in front of you and you can enjoy it while it's still hot.The dessert was okay- just slices of cakes. The manager, Ricardo is great.

"Back when I was in college in Philadelphia, Fogo de Chão was one of two Brazilian steakhouses in the city. Unfortunately, as it was also the more expensive of the two, I had never been able to visit, so it wasn't until they opened their first NYC location and started participating in Restaurant Week that I was finally able to go. After getting a reservation for six and confirming with five friends, we were set to visit this rodizio. The location is convenient for most in Midtown West and the venue consists of two floors: the bar and lobby on the ground level, and the actual restaurant in the lower level.Fogo has a pretty standard set up, comparable to most rodizio restaurants: Guests are offered a serve-yourself salad bar before starting with the churrascarias. The salad bar is far from ordinary, although it does consist of your standard greens, salad toppings, and dressings. There's also a variety of cured meats (prosciutto, salmon, salami, etc.) and cheeses as well as a tasty array of pre-made salads, which included my favorite apple and walnut salad. It's important not too fill up too much on this course, however, as to leave room for the star of the show: the churrasaria.Each guest is given a circular card that initially appears to be a coaster, but actually serves as an indicator that the diner is ready for the proteins; flip onto the green side to signal ""yes"" and flip onto the red side to signal ""no"". If all goes as planned, waiters will stop by the table bearing a variety of proteins on skewers to ask (if applicable) what cook on your meat you prefer. Fogo offers a dizzying number of options, so it's important to pick and choose wisely among the many selections. I'd advise against getting the Frango, or chicken, even though it's wrapped in bacon or the too dry Lombo, or pork loin. Instead, save up for the excellent Picanha and Alcatra (top sirloin cuts), Pork Ribs, and Cordeiro (leg of lamb). The latter proteins are gently seasoned, tender, and retain plenty of flavor in each cut.It's feasible for vegetarians and pescatarians to eat here, as they have a Salad Bar-only option, as well as a few seafood options daily as well. Regardless, Fogo is definitely better suited for the carnivores and omnivores, especially those with solid appetites.",4.0,"Oct 20, 2014"
"The service was impeccable. When I came here with my friends, a few of us were running late. They would only seat us if everyone in our party was present which wasn't a big deal to me since it was our fault. The hostess was respectful and even directed me to sit at the bar as I waited for the last member of our party. The food was amazing both the cuts of meat and the buffet bar. My favorite cut was the top and bottom sirloin, the meat was juicy, tender and cooked perfectly. I would recommend this place to my friends and I plan to come back in the near future.",5.0,"May 18, 2015"
"Extremely disappointed. I definitely expected better being that the NY one is excellent and never disappoints. To start off, our table was very poorly serviced. We were missing silverware, and instead of salt and pepper containers that were efficient, they were empty and both labeled ""pepper."" We were not greeted decently, our waitress seemed to be going through something and that energy and lack of enthusiasm was brought to our table. The meats brought out were ""ok"" and at the end we found out that we were not eligible for the 39.00 service as we were given full service that included beef ribs that never even came around our table. THE WORST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER!  I wish that the service would have been better. Furthermore, we noticed at the end we never received cheesy bread. Overall a huge disappointment and not worth it for the 124.00 bill we paid (not including tip). Texas De Brazil is so much better!",1.0,"Oct 25, 2019"

"NOTE: 4.5 StarsFinally got a chance to try the world famous Fogo de Chao steakhouse and it did not disappoint. There have been quiet a few Brazilian steakhouse's in NYC (and Long Island) that I have been to. Each with their own little perks that make them great. Greenfields has fallen off and the Rodizio chains have all but disappeared leaving Fogo de Chao to take the crown and they have done so. First of all I came here for restaurant week. Didn't end up ordering from the RW 2015 menu which was $20 dollars cheaper. It was nice that they offer that. I don't recall the other Brazilian spots offering that deal so thats a huge plus. The meat selection was amazing. I mean that is what you come there before. The salad bar was not the best. The stuff they had was nice but other places offered quite a bit more as far as sides go and hot dishes. Still all of this is forgotten when a large selection of tasty meats come steaming your way. The other great thing about Fogo de Chao is the service. Staff is very friendly. The waiter would come around and ask if there was something I didn't try that I would like to. It does get business in there and not all the selections will come to your area. Don't deprive yourself, just let your waiter know. Plus there might be a few things not on the regular menu that you have to ask for from the back. So overall I highly recommend this place. The salad bar was meh but everything else was very much on point. If you are cheap sumbitch wait til restaurant week is going on and you can chow down at almost half the price (for 2).",4.0,"Mar 23, 2015"
"Delicious food!  Perfect for group dinning / dinner parties.  Their lemonade is fantastic!  But sadly they don't have Brazilian juices such as passion fruit or caju.  If your new to Brazilian style steakhouse,  they have a buffet of salad and other things,  and then bring the roasted meats around to your table.  I loved the sausage and the chicken wrapped in bacon.  Perfect for meat lovers and people who love to ear a lot in one sitting.",4.0,"Jul 1, 2016"
"This place is consistently going above and beyond to satisfy its patron's desires. Every Fogo I have been to has excellent food, of course, but also excellent service. If there is a specific cut of meat you would like, just tell the gauchos and they'll make sure it makes its way to you!Things to know:The picanha (spelling?) is amazing- perfectly seasoned, super flavorful, and very tender. It's no wonder it's their specialty/ most popular cut.The lamb chops are out of control. Do yourself a favor and make sure you get these. They don't make the rounds as often as other cuts, so be sure to ask if you have to. And ask for it medium rare. You're welcome.Even though the salad bar is full of really great and tasty things, don't be a rookie! Only grab a couple of things so you can focus on the real star- the meats! Guys, if you want to take your girl on a fancy, awesome, impressive date, I say go no further. This place gives you a serious bang for your buck... UNLESS! She doesn't eat a lot/ is the type to just order a salad. Don't get me wrong, the salad bar is awesome. But... Personally I like making sure those $50 are well spent. Someone told me there was a red side to the card... I wouldn't know.They also have an awesome limeaid drink with sweet condensed milk. It's different but really really good.The wine selection is bomb. The cellar looks like it's floating over the seating area- nice work, Fogo.Anyways, this place is clearly awesome.

"Overrated and overpriced.Ive heard a lot about Fogo and I'll even say that maybe this location is just mediocre, but I will definitely go to another restaurant when I want better options for a cheaper more reasonable price.First off, the general ambience of the place is very nice. It is in Midtown, so you should always opt for reservations than walking in imo.The service this night was perfectly fine. Our bread, sides and water were consistently refilled and our waiter was attentive enough.But the food here was a complete let down. I always hear about the salad bar at Fogo and how big and plentiful it is, so maybe it was just this spot but they had just about next to nothing for a Friday night. The only thing I really had any interest in was the cesar salad and some sides of fruit. The meats seemed OK, there was an improper ration of beef to just about everything. We were only offered pork maybe twice and chicken literally once. I wasnt a fan, I felt I did not get the variety of what I was paying for. Im typically a medium cooked lover but on this night everything was a little too bloody for me personally.So for the lack of options in meats and sides (no chicken basically) for $62 dollars pp and $11 glasses of wine, paying close to $200 to eat here felt like a rip off. If I felt like the experience was amazing and there was just so much to choose from it was overwhelming, then I'd totally be okay with the price but it wasnt that at all. 3 stars, no give or take.",3.0,"Jan 15, 2017"

"We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Very attentive waiter - recommended a cocktail served in a pineapple that was out of this world good.

I loved the filet mignon and bacon wrapped chicken and my husband enjoyed the ribs and sirloin most. Before we passed out from a food coma, we had delicious desserts (chocolate cake and caramelized pineapple). Every waiter/server wad professional, friendly and the service was exceptional. Well worth the $$$$$. We will need several days to digest.",5.0,"May 15, 2015"
"Fogo de Chão is one of my favorite places to visit. It's a traditional churrasco experience and is worth the price. If you are paleo or keto, this is a great place to eat. So many meats and sides to choose from. You get to eat as you please and sample a variety of dishes, but my favorite is the picanha and sea bass. The market table is always a hit with my friends, with a selection of salad options and charcuterie. The interior is classy and clean and the service is always impeccable. It is pricier than the other Fogo de Chão restaurants I've been to, but that's to be expected in NYC. If you're worried about the price, I would definitely give it a trial run during NYC restaurant week!",5.0,"Jul 21, 2017"
"Being a huge fan of steakhouses, Fogo de Chao was on the top of my list for Restaurant Week. Their location being in midtown is super convenient and the restaurant itself is beautiful. There is plenty of seating downstairs and a bar upstairs. The salad bar seemed to have less than other Brazilian steakhouses, but you don't want to get full of that anyways. Not sure if it was because of restaurant week, but we also felt that a lot of the meat was very dry. Overall, the service was very pleasant.",4.0,"Feb 22, 2017"
"Great location/decor. Amazing service. Food was good, nothing out of this world.The ambiance and decor is very modern. Went to the bar upstairs while waiting to be seated. Quick service, great prices on beer considering the area.Once seated, went to the salad station and grabbed a few items. Nothing crazy, typical salad bar. Ordered the restaurant week special. $38 for 12 different types of meat, mashed potatoes, sweet plantain, & polenta. All average. The meat was alright, some were a bit salty. Quantity is never a problem in churrascarias. The quality is a bit average. Maybe I was expecting better. Although I wasn't able to try their filet mignon, ribeye, and a couple of other cuts. MAYBE that's where the difference maker is. I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses where the quality of meat was much better. Dessert was average. Cheesecake and chocolate cake. Although you can barely enjoy it after eating all that abundance of food.I gave it 3 stars bc of the food. Which is the primary reason for going to a restaurant. But I can't stress enough, the service was perfect. Everyone is on point from the bus boys, to the guys cutting the meat. Everyone does their part and you get that impeccable service whether you pay full price or go for restaurant week. The place is nice and is a great place to take family from out of town or if you're all about quantity.Would've probably given it 3.5 stars but rounded down this time around. But give it a shot, everyone's taste buds are different.",3.0,"Feb 25, 2015"

And boy, do they have a TON of gluten free options (I'd say about 95% of the food there is gluten free). They even gave us complimentary dessert to go since it was my fiancé's birthday.

"We went there couple of days ago. This evening was suppose to be an amazing evening for us but this place just ruined everything.Left such a bad taste in our mouth that it haunted us even up until the next day. Can't believe we spent $170 dollars for lettuce and dressing!? We initially thought ""oo wow brazilian place, we are probably gonna get a burst of flavors in our mouth after eating their food!"" but it was soooooooo the opposite!! We usually spent 30-45 mins in a restaurant eating food, after the food is served. We literally were in this place may be 15 mins. We ate and everything else was over. This place is AMAZING for those people who haven't been to any 5 star restaurants. You are basically paying $70 per person for salad bar. The meat that the waiters were bringing around you, was burnt, undercooked, tasteless, cold, red/pink and bloody. There is no such thing as EXPERIENCE in this place. its just a dining room with salad bar and waiters walking around with shish kebobs. The warm stuff in the salad bar like the soup was COLD. everything else the ""steamed"" asparagus the ""string beans"" were COLD! The 3 ""free"" sides (which is really not free) was COLD!! Time would've been better spent in APPLE BEES than here. Hell...we got a better dining experience at the dollar menu at McDonalds. Even Old Country Buffet is WAY BETTER!! This place is just an over priced salad bar!! spent about $170 for lettuce and Italian dressing!!? NOT COUNTING DRINKS!! OH FOR THOSE ITS EXTRA! IM SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T CHARGE YOU FOR THE WATER! We spent close to $300 in TAO and even THAT WAS WELLLLLLL worth it ! NOW TAO! IS AN EXPERIENCE ! AMBIANCE, FOOD, DRINKS AND SERVICE!! Well worth the money we spent! WE have no problems spending thousands of dollars in food with experience but this place I wouldn't even spend $10 dollars in!Will never recommend this place to any of our friends. I have never written reviews for any other place ever in my life didn't think it was worth it. But this place definitely deserved all the heat! I'm still very angry over going to this place.

The hostess escorted us  down the stairs to our table and I got this immediate feeling of being on a cruise ship . We were then told that there was no menu but we could help ourselves to the ""market table "" .... now by this point I was pretty convinced I was on a ship with a terrible buffet .... it looked like the deli section in the supermarket ...  cold mashed potatoes and some mushy  bananas were then served ..... then came the red roast beef , which was oddly cut from all angles and needed my assistance to be lifted off the skewer ... some more meat ...... and then some more ... no sauces were ever discussed ... a few chicken thighs passed by and then more meat ....  I looked down on my plate and saw meat , bloody red meat , everywhere . I felt sea sick now . Check please . I just want to go home and get some mouthwash . But all kidding aside it was awful!

"I know it's mid-town NYC, but this placed seemed slightly over priced for what it is. A typical dinner, with 1 drink, will run you around $100pp after tax and tip. In terms of the food, they seemed to come around with the cheaper meats much more often (especially in the beginning) and the waiter service was lacking, often skipping at least 1 member of our party. Comparatively, the other mid-town location seemed slightly more upscale (even had a pianist playing) and had slightly better cuts of meat.",3.0,"Nov 29, 2016"

For $60 bucks waiters come and serve you 10+ different kinds of meat (filets, strip, chicken, sausages, etc), plus you get to enjoy a massive salad bar and a wide variety of free sides (cheesy bread, plantains, etc). In terms of how formal the place is, you see a range from a little more casual (collared shirt and jeans) to formal (suit).

"Let me start by saying that Fogo de Chao had always been a synonym for excellent customer service and the unparalleled art of preparing high-quality meats Brazilian style. Having dined at Fogo numerous times over the last couple of years, I had not been disappointed once - a visit to Fogo de Chao was always something special, which is why I decided to make reservations for New Year's at the recently opened Fogo de Chao in New York. I'm afraid we'll remember that dinner for a long way - not in a good way, though.Our server was uninterested and seemingly annoyed he had to work on New Year's Eve - accordingly, service we received from him was just sub-par: After delivering drinks and sides, he disappeared and never checked on us to refill drinks or pick up plates. Service provided by the ""gaucho chefs"" was at a similar low level: Although we were seated quite close to the kitchen, meats would only be served every 10-15 minutes. When they finally arrived, they were lukewarm and either extremely dry or half-raw inside. Undercooked sausage anyone?I informed the manager on duty (Lily) about the situation. She promised to ""check what's going on"" and bring quality of service back to the high level we were used to from our past visits at other locations. Shortly after our conversation, a gaucho chef indeed came with the requested picanha - however, despite our polite request to slice the pieces ""thin"" and ""medium rare"", he cut 2-3"" thick slobs of meat onto our plates that were completely raw inside and simply inedible! I signaled Lily (who had been watching the scene from nearby) and showed her what we had been served. She agreed that for a restaurant priding itself in the preparation of meat, the situation was ""completely unacceptable,"" and she ""didn't know what was going wrong today."" Unfortunately, Lily's promise to ""take our plates to the kitchen and show the chefs"" seemed to be more of an excuse for her to get out of an uncomfortable situation, as she never returned to our table to resolve the problem.The buffet, which we decided to try while waiting for Lily, was equally disappointing: At around 8:00pm, many popular items (such as Prosciutto ham or Parmigiano cheese) were gone and not refilled. On the other hand, I found the men's bathrooms extremely dirty and they looked as if they hadn't been serviced for a while either. Finally, we were not surprised when our waiter came to drop the bill without any comments (not even asking whether we were done or wanted any desserts). No adjustments had been made, however at this point, we were happy to just leave this restaurant.While I'd like to believe that our dinner on New Year's Eve dinner a one-off exception, the indifferent attitude and the clumsy, atrocious service we received from staff and management alike rather suggests a pattern of poor leadership and/or lack of training at the New York location.",2.0,"Jan 5, 2015"

It was a big disappointment for the other cuts of meats because it was cold, tough and tasteless.Servers were attentive and brought out drinks and sides when requested. To be quite honest, the fried bananas (plantains), prime rib and rib eye saved this review from being 2 stars.",3.0,"Feb 12, 2018"
"Pretty unimpressed with this place considering their reputation and good Yelp rating. What makes Fogo de Chao unique is the churrascaria style of food and service-- but I think that novelty should only go so far. Yeah it was cool, but I found myself wondering if the restaurant would be as popular had they served the same exact food straight from the kitchen. I was happy with the hostess and overall first impression. She was sweet and accommodating while I waited for my guest to arrive. When she did, we were escorted downstairs to our seats and were soon greeted by a server who seemed to be in a rush. It wasn't that bad, maybe not even worth mentioning. But it was something I noticed.We began at the salad bar which was just a little bit underwhelming. The best parts were the smoked salmon and mozzarella. Looking back at other people's photos, I see that we were missing a lot of the good stuff. maybe because it's restaurant week? But come on. There wasn't any fish, potatoes, pasta. Just your regular salad bar suspects with a few extras like the smoked salmon, prosciutto and salami. Not impressed. I tried not to fill up on the salad bar as I had been warned. A man came over to our table to offer their special restaurant week drink which was a caipirinha inside a pineapple. We ordered one to share. Turns out, the pineapple was a $9 upcharge at $24. Could have done without it. The meats were good. I particularly liked the BBQ pork ribs and sausage. I found they were most flavorful. I also liked the sirloin and parmesan pork. The Parmesan pork was weird though. Not crusted at all, seemed like pork rolled around in Parmesan cheese both in texture and presentation. I could have done without the bacon wrapped chicken. The sides were okay. The caramelized bananas were slightly more mushy than they should have been, the polenta was good and the mashed potatoes were downright bad. Wow, they were SOOO bad. They had literally zero flavor. It was like eating powder that tasted like water.The BEST part for me was the pao de queijo. Soooooo delicious. I was stopping myself from eating them because I wanted to save room but I shouldn't have. They were amazing. The deserts were alright, I had the NY cheesecake as per my waiters suggestion and it was good but could have been colder. It was very soft. And my guest had the chocolate cake which was good. What annoyed me was that I specified that it was my guest's birthday. Both on reservation and to the hostess, but there wasn't any Happy Birthday on her desert plate like I've seen them do in pictures. I'm not sure how they missed this because she even had a happy birthday gift bag on her chair. Whatever. Overall I think that for the money I spent, I could have had a much better meal. I won't return because of the many other fantastic restaurants that this area has to offer. It was an experience I'm glad I had nonetheless.",3.0,"Jul 31, 2015"
"It is really all about the experience here, and not necessarily about the food, such a fun place.  My boyfriend and I took his 15 year old nephew here, thinking it would be right up the growing teen's alley...and it surely was.The salad bar had extensive options, yet not overdone for sure.  Surprisingly my favorite was the potato salad, and had quite a few servings of that.  The passed meats were good, although not great.  I may be a tougher critic on it, since I really like my beef as rare as rare can get, and it is hard to get that desired doneness in this type of situation.  The chicken pieces were great though, ribs were good, and also really enjoyed the lamb.  The fried polenta was great, and caramelized bananas even better.Overall, the service was really prompt and attentive.  The concept and atmosphere is fun, and as far as the food is concerned, it is really more about quantity here than quality.  I would return here again with out of towners, or the like, but as a native New Yorker there are plenty other options with better food choices I would choose over this.",4.0,"Nov 18, 2014"

"First Class Dining experience.  My wife told me she wanted to try this restaurant .  She mentioned that it was all you can eat.  the first thing that entered my mind was this must be some kind of fast food buffet style hole in the wall. Boy was I wrong.    The first thing I found out was they have a truly wonderful system of service.  we made reservations for 7 pm and we were seated and served by 7.05 pm . and the place was packed. how you might ask? this is like no other restaurant I have ever been to.you are given a round card that is red on one side and green on the other. if you place the green side up.  you will be offered all kinds of different meats and cheeses. one by one about ten waiters will take turns coming to your table with a tray of different steaks chops cheeses etc. one will offer lamb chops the next will offer eye round steaks and so on.   need a break ? no problem. flip the card to red and the waiters will know that you don't want any more food or drink until you again flip the green side up. once you do the waiters will continue to bring you all kinds of delicious food and drinks.    this includes a salad bar with lots of cheeses meats and vegetables that is self serve. and you can serve yourself as often as you like.the price for all this is $59 per person for all you can eat .  the food is delicious. the lamb chops melt in your mouth. Every thing tasted great  out of the six different steaks I tried i found the eye round medium rare and. the lamb chops were my favorites  Not included in the package are drinks and deserts.  They have a huge selection of wines and other spirits.  My wife and I decided to get a glass bottle of diet coke instead which is reasonably priced at $3,50. after that we had dessert i had a nice slice of key lime pie  my wife had a large mountain of warm chocolate cake with ice cream. both of our desserts were $10 each we also had two cups of coffee and two glasses of water for free.    all in all this is by far the most enjoyable dining experience  we can remember so we tipped 22 percent and still paid under $200 .  This is also a very High class elegant steakhouse. we were told that the dress code is casual.but many diners were in suites  or suit jackets or at least wore collared shirts. I felt under dressed with my black t shirt and shorts and sandals but this was not an issue at all. The waitstaff was so friendly and the customer service was top notch .

"The Meats are DELICIOUS!! Continuous Offerings of meats, come with an appetite and expandable clothing...lolI visited with my 2 daughters and son inlaw and we left very satisfied. Service was superb. Price fixe per person, I thought was reasonable for meal.",5.0,"Dec 5, 2015"
"Went with a friend who raved about the food and drinks.   We sat upstairs in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour specials.    Our server took our drink and app orders and then disappeared.   Eventually the drinks came but we never did get the apps.   The food was not added but due to the server ghosting, the happy hour special had ended and he charged us full price.   The manager fixed the bill, but it took a good 20 mins for them to figure out how to refund my credit card.   I think we may have caught them on a bad day?   I want to go back for dinner at some point and hopefully had a better experience.",3.0,"Sep 13, 2017"
"I've never had better meat in my life. I don't know how this place stays in business serving an all-you-can-eat style. The unique temperature of their style of cooking makes for a truly unique experience. The dining room is beautiful. I didn't have any wine, but I would have paid for the view of their wine room alone. Service was tremendous. I will never skip a visit when a friend visits the city!",5.0,"Jul 18, 2018"
"Was there last Sunday for my birthday and the service was excellent! Everyone was super nice and they gave me complimentary cheesecake for my birthday and didn't even charge us a cake cutting or plate fee for bringing our own cake, unlike other restaurants. Everyone is so sweet and accommodating. My party was a little late and they held our table and reservation no problem. Food is awesome, meat is good, I would definitely recommend this place. They treat you like kings. So nice!",5.0,"Oct 14, 2017"
"Let me just get this out of the way really quickly: I ate here for restaurant week, and it turned out to be one of the best meals I can remember.Now my reservation was for lunch, 11:30ish, but that didn't stop people from packing the place full. I guess on the closing end of restaurant week, everyone wanted a chance to try it. The staff kept up admirably though - it took a few to get us seated, but after that, they were on point the entire meal.So let's talk salad bar. Being the red-blooded, meat-eating, hippie-hating American that I am, I gave a lot more attention to the meats and cheeses (prosciutto, salmon, swiss cheese, some cheese I can't remember, you get the idea) than I did to the fresh produce and beans, but the options were incredible, and they all looked fantastic.But you don't come here for the salad bar. You come here for the carnivorous carnival that is the many offerings of varied meats. The bacon-wrapped chicken might have been my favorite, but pretty much everything was excellent. My only gripe was that my parmesean steak had quite a bit of grizzle to it, but when I tried a second piece, it was excellent.My advice: Pace yourself. The offers of meat come fast, and if you say yes to every single one immediately, you'll either choke or eat yourself sick. Take your time, savor the flavors. I hope you like your meat on the rarer side though, since I didn't really see anything over medium. Of course, if you're getting steak cooked past medium, you're probably a bad person.Oh, and last thing - the chocolate mousse cake and key lime pie were both excellent! The slices were small and light, which was perfect after the giant lunch. It kept me full right through the day.",5.0,"Aug 10, 2014"
My husband and I came here during restaurant week for his birthday. It was overall not a very good experience. The meats didn't taste as good as I remembered when we went a few years ago to the Philadelphia location and the service wasn't great either. We waited a while to get the check and then once we gave our card they gave our credit card back to the wrong table and we got someone else's card. They did put a little candle in the dessert for my husbands birthday which was nice. What ruined the whole experience was I saw someone on the way to the bathroom to throw up. It made me nervous if it was the food or an unrelated reason and I guess I will never know. But as we walked out we saw some throw up on the ground and the workers weren't even worried about cleaning it up.,2.0,"Jan 28, 2018"
"We were told by a friend to make a reservation so we did. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, got a drink at the bar and were quickly seated, our waiter explained how the ordering process works. The meat was never ending, and you had your choice of different kinds and cuts of meat. They ranged from lamb chops to fillet mignons and smoked sausages. The meats were cut right in front of you. We all had our steaks medium rare- medium. Delicious. There was also an open salad bar that consisted of cooked rice, different cheeses and deli meats...which I later took advantage of. The starters here weren't bad either. Definitely try the garlic mashed potatoes, polenta and cheese bread. Thank you for a great experience..",5.0,"Apr 22, 2015"
"Amazing! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Soooo good! For the price, I believe it's worth it. It's like a steak buffet!! The garlic steak was the BEST! So good, I actually cried!

"Came here for restaurant week with the girlfriend. First time here so had high hopes. They have a nice salad bar with a huge selection which is great and a few other appetizers on the table at all times (mashed potatoes, sweet bananas, and polenta). But the main attraction is the meat. For the restaurant week menu, they had chicken, lamb, ribs, pork, sirloin, and a few others. Flip the card to green and the food just keeps coming. Props to them for the fast customer service. The table was always filled with food at all times. Flip the card to red and you can just enjoy the meal. They also had this pineapple drink special for restaurant week which was like their version of a Pina colada but on the rocks and it was really strong (in my opinion). The only reason for one less star is because all the meats were extremely salty. So much so that for the leg of lamb, I was able to taste the grains of salt...",4.0,"Jan 27, 2016"
"Similar to other Brazilian steakhouses. The meats didn't come around and often and there wasn't much variety.  It was also a busy day so it was hard to tell.

"Among the long list of things I don't enjoy are Restaurant Week and all you can eat buffets. For me, both are just not worth it-- so it's ironic that it was Restaurant Week that convinced me to make a reservation at Fogo de Chao. But how can you blame me? Normally priced at $60, dinner is now $38. Everything from the normal menu, except for the lamb chops & filet mignon, are included. The meats exceeded my expectations, and there were lots of options. I tried them all! They were all juicy, flavorful, and well-seasoned. I requested rare cuts and was actually given rare cuts. The leg of lamb was stand out, and was the only meat that I requested seconds (ok, thirds) of!The sides are refilled as often as you please. That Cheesy Bread is borderline magical; the Crispy Polenta, Sweet Plantains, and Mashed Potatoes are dangerous. And while you may think you're wasting valuable stomach estate on plants by visiting the salad bar, you're not. Breaking up the protein-fest with fresh, roasted, and pickled veggies actually sustained our marathon meal. And marathon it was! We didn't permanently turn our cards over to the red side until 2.5 hours later, and we never felt rushed to leave.But wait, there's more! Dessert was also included, and we decided on the Chocolate Mousse Cake and Key Lime Pie. Even though I told myself I wouldn't over eat... I couldn't help it when these came out!And now... I may have to reconsider my stance on Restaurant Week & buffets.",4.0,"Aug 8, 2014"
"Im so disappointed of choosing this restaurant for my anniversary celebration. Hubby and I used to live in FL and we had celebrate our last 4 anniversary's at Fogo de chão. We moved to Westchester county almost a year ago and since I wanted to keep the tradition I decided to hit the city and visit the New York location. As mention before I dont live in the city so I call to make the reservation and make sure everything be perfect for our special date. When I call I talk to Ashley I told her I needed a reservation for my anniversary, at the time I call she explain they were having issues with the booking system but she was placing a note to make sure they got us in schedule as soon as they fix the system. Talking to Ashley I told her I was coming from out of the city, also mention all the special details and even said that manager Ezekiel was aware of the situation and will make sure to get the reservation. I ask if I had to call again later on and they said NO. ""Everything is taken care of"". We got there on Saturday, the weather was stormy but we made it anyways. We go in and the hostess was not attentive, I just said my name and that we had a reservation, she look at me like ""whatever"" because the restaurant was not packed, the restaurant is stunning, table was ok, server ask for our drinks, and we went to the salad bar, and ready to eat. The meat and food from the bar was good as always but the sides? Omg the pao de queijo that they serve us was baked like 7 days ago, It was like a baseball ball If it hit you in the head I could kill you, the mashed potatoes and polenta frites were also like preheated. The servers were not paying attention to the flipping cards, not even to refill water. I ask the server for another bread but it never came, also I asked for some churrasco and they never approach my table with it and at that point I didn't want to get more upset and ruined my special day so i said forget it ! At the end we order coffee and obviously the dessert so I could finally celebrate with a Happy anniversary greeting after all this horrible service. but guess what? NOT even a happy anniversary on my dessert. To be honest that was heart breaking for me. Because I took the time to reserve, make the call and assure that every detail was going to be special and it did NOT happen that way, not even close it was the worse anniversary. And the saddest thing is that I could have go to so many places in NY and I pick this place. Sorry but never again they lost us as customer. Also the manager or any assistant never came to our table to ask if everything was ok and thats done in Florida so I assumed its part of the restaurant protocol guess not here. I'm so mad I could keep on going but its not worth it! Just go to Morton's or the Palm that service will never disappoint you. For my birthday the even got me a menu with my name and a picture of us to take home!",1.0,"Aug 23, 2016"
"My Puppy (girlfriend) and I went to Fogo de Chão and let me tell you, most if not all of them eats more amazing. We went on a rainy Tuesday night around 730 I think. The moment we stepped into the restaurant, I knew everything was going to be and pleasant experience. Soon as we walk in the hostesses were very nice. They looked up our reservation on the computer and then took us to our seats. Once we sat down the waiter took our drink orders, me and my puppie got a Corona and water. If you been to a steakhouse before, you know how this works. If not, let me explain it, you sit down and the meat start rolling in.. Nonstop! Literally nonstop.. Not but really, you put your belongings down at your table and you go to the salad bar. The trick is not to fill up on the salad bar, so you can enjoy all the meats that they bring around. I tried to tell my puppy that but she loves her bread. I took a little bit of salad and one pice of bread. But their salad bar is tremendous, Believe me. The end of the day you're not there for that, you're there to try all of the delicious, tender, juicy and flavorful meats. When we sat back down there is a complementary mashed potatoes, plantains and a little breads filled with cheese (cheese balls) that were marvelous. Of course my puppy had to get a second order of that because they were good. I don't blame her, They were phenomenal. Especially when they first came out, and they were nice and hot, OMG!! But who cares, you don't go to Fogo de Chão for that. You have to keep your eye on the prize which is all the magnificent meat. On the table, there is a red and green circular card. That controls the flow of the meat. You already know my puppy and I had that card on during the whole entire time, because that's what we're there for. They had all the meat you can think of, they had garlic steak, chicken wrapped in bacon, beef wrapped in bacon, ribs, sausages, Chicken with Parmesan all over it, three different kind of porkchops, skirt steak, lamb and many more. The list goes on an on. And all the meets were very flavorful, none of them were dry. The only bad thing about this place is that, the salad bar needs to be smaller. Because people get caught up on that, and you're not there for that. Me and my puppy also had dessert that dessert was amazing. We have the cheesecake with nothing on it and we had a lava cake with ice cream. Both of the desserts were very moist and also not too sweet. Some restaurants can make a really sweet cheesecake or their lava cake would not be is moist. Fogo de Chão hit it right on the money. I'm pretty sure me and my puppy will come back here in the future, but no time soon because we have so many other spots to hit.... But see you soon.",5.0,"Oct 3, 2017"
"What a great experience. Went for lunch.CONS:- I walk in to an empty waiting area at 2pm, and ask for a table for one and the hostess says she'll be with me for a minute. There's another dude there who has reservations. Alright no problem. Another party walks in, reservations again. Everyone is getting seated or gathering party members. Another guy is waiting for the rest of his party and gets chatting with the hostess. 10 minutes go by and I'm wondering whats going on. As soon as I go over to see how crowded the dining area is, the hostess finally remembers the only other dude standing in the room... me. She did apologize profusely but had I been an impatient person, this is the part where somebody makes a scene.Finally I get downstairs and see what its all about . Damn this place looks like a swanky hotel.Pros:Service is top notch. You sit down and get surrounded by side dishes and cheesy bread. Meat comes by every minute and another host is making sure everything is perfect at all times... even asking if there's a specific meat you want to come over. This is the first place I've been to that made me feel like royalty... and I was just a dude in a polo and khakis.The salad bar is alright, nothing really special. They have cheese, cold cuts, potato salad type stuff. I loved the home made bacon/pork rinds. Don't bother filling up here.The meat - nice and salty. Very juicy for the most part. You get so much so I'd honestly just skip anything chicken. A did have some crusted pork that was a bit dry but everything else was great. There's also a menu on the table so you can see everything available in case you want to wait for something specific.Lunch was a bit steep for $40+tip so make the most of it and go for the meat.I have also been to the other Brazillian place down the street but I'd have to say this one is a bit better and service here has a WOW factor.",4.0,"Aug 29, 2014"
"Disappointed by the service. The food was so delicious but we saw our waitress once and she never came back. We had to keep asking other waiters that came by to find her and then when that didn't work we had to ask other waiters for things. We were supposed to have mashed potatoes/polenta/bananas refilled like the other tables around us, but we only got the original one. We also never got drink refills. The managers came over at the end after we waited almost 30 minutes for a cup of coffee. When she heard what happened she brought the coffee straight out. Then she came to check again but we had been sitting for another 45 minutes waiting for the check. She tried to make up for it by taking the drinks, dessert and coffee off the bill and giving us a gift card for a free dinner but being forgotten for 3 hours left its mark. Again, food was wonderful but the service was severely lacking.",1.0,"Mar 27, 2017"
This place is very beautiful and huge on the inside. My best friend and I went to Brazil over the summer and tried our first Brazilian stake house over there and fell in love. We saw that this place was on the list for restaurant week we were so excited. When we came it was crowded but it was the last day of restaurant week so it was expected. The food was OK like nothing special at all. We only enjoyed the chicken and One of the stakes they brought out. Every other meat that was brought out either had no flavor or tasted like rubber. I was even disappointed at the salad bar selection. All in all the service was great but the steak could be improved greatly.,3.0,"Mar 2, 2017"

Traditional Brazilian restaurant where they come around with the different meats. The salad bar is far better here than at many non Brazilian restaurants. Try their house special meat. I can't remember the name but they will tell you it's the house special. Melts in your mouth. Large spacious area not crammed into a small space like I find myself in many restaurants.Overall great experience. I came here yesterday and needed to try it again today. I just read what I wrote out loud. I am not an employee here. It was just a great place to eat. Again..... Not an employee.,5.0,"Sep 29, 2014"

"I'm tempted to give it 3 stars because the ambience feels so touristy and the prices are pretty exorbitant, but I can't deny that the quality of the meal was still pretty darn impressive.A good friend of mine was in town, and while we were scoping out dinner options he noticed Fogo de Chão as he had been to their other locations in a few other cities and raved about them.  Our decision was made.First off, I hope you're a hardcore carnivore.  Otherwise, you're essentially paying $60 for a glorified salad bar, which actually does have plenty of great options, but isn't what you should be filling up on.Save your appetite for the all-you-can-eat roasted meats that come to your tableside non-stop.  Think Brazilian dim sum.  Beef rules all at Fogo (fillet, sirloin, etc.), and though I don't eat beef, I still had plenty of options.  Chicken, pork and lamb galore!  A few of them were a bit too salty for my taste, but overall the seasonings were great, and the meat cooked to perfection, whether you prefer medium, rare or whatever.  Lamb chops were probably my favorite, very juicy.  Chicken wrapped in bacon was also amazing, but then again, anything wrapped in bacon is probably amazing. Slight deduction as we felt gypped that the Brazilian soda (served in a can) is $4 and desserts are all $12 each.  There's no drink/dessert menu, they simply ask you what you want.  If we had known, we probably would have shared a dessert.  All in all it's a great meal, and you will not leave hungry that's for sure!",4.0,"Sep 23, 2014"
"TO DIE FOR!!! Slightly beats out Churrascaria Plataforma for me. Fantastic meat. Excellent salad bar with great specialty salads, imported salami, prosciutto & cheeses, smoked salmon, vegetables and more. Amazing sides- must try the cheesy bread rolls & caramelized bananas!

"Pretty good experience especially if you are really hungry. However, the meat is either still mooing and grazing or it's very well done. Get it together please, medium is they key to yummy meat.

Garlic steak is the only winner of night otherwise this would have been a 3 star review.",4.0,"Jun 25, 2017"
"Might seem gimmacky but this experience is a fun one, and the food quality and service is quite goof. Buyer beware: you will feel sick with food fullness. I am still feeling it almost a day later. As such, I don't think I will go back because I'd probably die of overeating.  I came for restaurant week, which apparently only gets you a few of the meats (not their top line filet or other stuff...but seriously if I had more meat, I would have probably exploded).  From $58 to $38 you get:-complimentary pao de quejo bread which was cheesy and oily but not as bready? I've had better but this was ok.- the unlimited salad bar. It's a mixture of standard stuff- greens, tomatoes, good asparagus, etc but also more South American tropical items like heart of palm, grilled eggplant (very good), strawberry salad, and an assortment of cured meats like really top line prosciutto (normally I don't like prosciutto), bacon, salami, and manchego, swiss and parm cheese.  You fill up just on this. -flip those cards up on green and get swarmed with meat, meat. meat. We tasted the roasted chicken leg (bf said it was dry but I thought it was crispy), chicken breast wrapped with bacon (good), top sirloin (nicely seasoned and crispy), bottom sirloin (also good, asked for a rarer piece- for the beef, you can get medium or medium rare since I guess all of the meats don't roast evenly on the pit), leg of lamb (I normally don't like lamb but this was well seasoned and not gamey or rubbery at all), pork sausage (salty, good), and pork rib (very good and charred).   TOO. MUCH. MEAT.  (toward the end, they will ask if what you're specifically looking for which is nice- lots of people on the floor)-you get the starch sides of fried banana (like maduros, carmelized and deliciously good), fried polenta (strong in polenta taste but kind of just fried whatever), and mashed potatoes (our least favorite, a bit bland). You can get a side of scalloped potato (cheesy), white rice (standard) and black bean (pretty flavorful and I don't even like these). -As for dessert, thankfully, they gave me a small portion of my requested key lime pie. It had a lot of cream on it but tasted like the usual tart/sweet key lime pie. Bf had the cheesecake (it was a little dense). I'm sure they don't make the desserts in house.. so whatevs-We had a bottle of the Trapche Oak Cask Malbec ($42 a bottle) which was acidic more than full bodied but still fruity. It was a nice compliment to the meal but I felt like dying with all the food and booze in me. -Finally, the space and decor: the space is a huge one, taking two floors and has a grand high-end chian like feel to it.  I would recommend but like I said.. buyer beware; don't eat all day when you come.",4.0,"Aug 6, 2014"
"My 1st time here and I LOVED it. From outside one would think it's a small, cozy, mom & pop type restaurant BUT it is the total opposite. Inside is huge. I found out place can fit up to 400 at one time. They have a wine wall; a wall of just wine bottles. It is a very classy, upscale restaurant without the strict dress code, uptight patrons,  and outrageous prices. I can't tell you how many different meats I ate, but never had it repeated. The dessert was my favorite. I had the tres leches and my boyfriend had the flan. Both was great as if homemade. What topped the whole experience is that we had a very polite, honest and courteous server; Julian. My boyfriend was in the restaurant biz and said he was very impressed by Julian so much so that he said he would come back and ask for him to tend to us.

Our friend noticed that the first time we flipped our cards to green we had someone there with a meat offering within like 10 seconds.  Our food was SO good.  I never though of myself as a ""rib-eye"" gal but have been thinking about how good that rib-eye was ever since.  The salad bar too, is outstanding.  You want to be careful you don't overdo that!

I used to look forward to coming here after work everyday as I waited for the subways to die down during rush hour, but management decided to make changes, and has completely destroyed the vibe for us regulars. They have fired at least two of my favorite bartenders for making human errors, and driven out many more by their horrible management style.

"Brazilian Steakhouses are one of my favorite meals. If you have not been, it is quite the experience. You start with the salad bar. However, it is a trap. You want to eat just a little bit to save room for the meat. You have a card that you flip to green (you want more meat) or red (you need a break or are done). The gauchos will come with a skewer of meat (steaks, chicken, ribs, pork, sausages, etc.) and offer you some if your card is green. They will probably ask offer anyway even if your card is red. By far, Fogo de Chao is my favorite Brazilian Steakhouse. Except for the Beverley Hills location, I have never had anything but an amazing experience. They have the best salad bar. I love the prosciutto and smoked salmon. In addition, they cook their meats the best compared to other Brazilian steakhouses I have tried. Their meats are very tender and have the best flavor. The complimentary sides of mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, and polenta. They are all good. In particular, the bananas are awesome. Since dinner is usually $60, the reduced Restaurant Week price provides a great opportunity to try Fogo de Chao. Although they will exclude their most premium cuts for the event, you get dessert which is normally not included. In the rare times I have made it to dessert, the selections were very good too. Furthermore, Fogo de Chao features my favorite soda, guarana. It is basically a cherry ginger ale.If you are looking for places to try for Restaurant Week,  feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my person list, which includes my Yelp reviews.

We went here during restaurant week so the price was more reasonable.  I hear the lunch prices aren't too bad either. I like the stairs to the upstairs bar and the downstairs seating. I felt the meat selection was very limited compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses I have been too.  Maybe that was due to the restaurant week menu?

Meat lovers are in paradise.Great convenient location right off the Theater district, beautiful and sumptuous dining room with great decor.Great service, friendly staff and impeccable food.Wide variety of meat cuts, pork, beef, lamb and chicken include.I hosted my Brazilian Aunt and friend from Brazil and they were impressed with the quality of the meat and the place.The Wine list is spectacular as well.One of the best dining experiences I had in a long time.Prices are on the high end, but this time I had a smile on my face even after taking the bill.I have visited other ""Fogo de Chão"", but the NYC is hands down the best one including the original restaurant in Porto Alegre, Brazil.",5.0,"Oct 23, 2014"

"I first spotted Fogo when I lived in Atlanta, but never made time to actually try it. Fast forward 10 (more like almost 15) years later and apparently I've been missing out. The decor at this location was gorgeous!!!Anyway, we went for a birthday celebration and celebrate we did. I didn't really grasp the concept of how the meats are served in a rapid fashion until it all started happening. I presumed there would be a full menu of the variety of meats available and we could choose from that. Nope! The wait staff brought every sample of meat fresh from the kitchen and once they saw that green ticket forget it! I wasn't ready! Had I been ready it would have been some trouble. Overall, everything was delicious from the area known as the market, which is a salad bar to the prime cuts of meat!!! The desserts were hit or miss and the drinks were great. I need to find more meat eaters in my life so we can venture to the Fogo in Baltimore!!!",4.0,"May 31, 2015"

"WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED in my life. I am a an extremely easy going customer and always gives everyone the benefit of the doubt and usually forgives a waiter if they do a bad job like ""maybe their having a bad day, it's okay!"" My boyfriend and I go out to eat at very nice restaurants in Manhattan 1-2x a week, everywhere and I'm always satisfied! I came to Fogo last weekend with my pharmacy school classmates/roommates (all respectful, kind, caring, and professional human beings) it was a birthday dinner. It was a party of 12 and we asked ahead of time if we can split it into 2 checks ahead of time, they waiter said it was fine. Every time the waiter spoke to us, he was rude and spoke to us as if we were idiots. For example it was some of our first time at an all you can eat Brazilian restaurant, the directions were given about the salad bar and making it seem like we would not willing to pay more for extra entrees. As if we weren't aware it was $60/person. I thought- maybe he's just having a bad night) silly me---Not only was the service with our waiter terrible, the waiter charged both checks incorrectly!! On one check, they added an additional person, on the other checks they charged us a 20% tip twice..(40% total) and on top of it they charged us drinks we did not order (the 5 people on my check had ZERO alcoholic beverages) We waited patiently as they brought back the corrected check... To notice this time they charged it incorrectly again. We only had the $59.95/person all you can eat meat and salad bar, no drinks, only hot tea for $3.95The total for 5 people (60x5)+4 for  one hot tea should be: $304$304 +(25.50 for 8.5%tax) +(60 for 20% tip)= $390.3They charged our credit cards to a total of $460, I don't know why they can't just do the math correct. They tried to give is $10 cash back per person and at that it would be too difficult to fix it. We were all in a rush to leave so we just took it event though it didn't cover why they actually owed us, a total of $60... Which still turns out to be an extra person eating all you can eat. Somehow they won and gipped us. Never coming back to this unprofessional business and making sure we tell all of our collages not to either. The food was not as amazing as what the other comments imply.",1.0,"Feb 3, 2015"

"Well, this was the second time i've done AYCE Brazilian in NYC. If Churrascaria Plataforma was a hipster, Fogo de Chao is his corporate brother wearing a three piece suit. That is not necessarily a bad thing.I came here with a group of 4 for restaurant week. How can you possibly turn down all the succulent meats of Brazil for just $39.99 (normally $59.99).  We made a reservation 1 week in advance and only had to wait 5 minutes with a cool little buzzer that reminded me of Cheese Cake Factory.Upon descending a steep winding stair case you access the main sesating area which really doesn't feel like New York City. The space is pretty massive. And there wasn't an empty table, because again the discount made it tough to pass up.The service was top notch. Our waiter appearaed moments after we sat and he asked us if we were here for restaurant week, which of course we all nodded vigorously to. He took our drink orders and told us to head to the salad bar first, then we get back they'll start with the meat service.I was very impressed by how healthy the salad bar choices were. If you were trying to go strictly paleo here, it would be easily accomplished. I munched on an assortment of veggies, but I was saving my appetite for the main attraction, all the meat!WIthout remembering every dish in detail, I can provide some of my opinions. The sirloin cut was juicy but a little salty for my likings. Their was an extremely succulent cut of lamb that I ate, which one member in our party (Alejandro) loved and I enjoyed a lot. Their signature prime rib was a touch on the dry side. Their were some other steak cuts that came out. I enjoyed some more than others, but the theme in my mind was that they were all a little salty for my taste. However, that was probably my only complaint as the meats were fresh and for the most part juicy.The desert I ordered (which was included with RW) was the chocolate mousse cake. It was delicious, I think I won in this department as the others who tried the Key Lime Pie weren't as satisifed.I thought the bathroom was really classy also. It was spacious with a marble finish. Again, more of that corporate thing.In the end, I ended up spending about $50 after tax,tip,and my non-alcoholic drink. I might return again for restaurant week if I was with somebody visiting from out of town. But I will say I left satisfied and it certainly was a 4 star experience.",4.0,"Mar 8, 2015"
"So disappointed ! From the start they told us to wait 15 minutes to be seated and the restaurant was half empty ! Well, after 20 minutes waiting we went to ask the girl and she checked the computer and didn't even had my name there. She called someone else , and the guy came to sit us. We were sit on a table in the back , near the cashier , almost under the stairs. Horrible table. I know spanish and portuguese and could understand the waitresses talking about other clients. The salad bar was not great , heart of palms -palmitos ( very known by brazilians) was hard and dry, not tasty at all. Not large variety of hot food to choose from. The meat rarely came to our table and two other tables near us, I asked the waiter to bring the check since we weren't being served and he rushed to talk to someone else to fix the problem. Lamb was really good, very tender and tasty. Some other meats were hard , no seasoning at all , even salt. It was out first time there, and I don't think we will come back. I've travelled to Brazil many times and we know how good are ""Brazilian churrascarias"" there. In NY we tried Plataforma and this one. The first one was really good experience, but this one a disappointment .",1.0,"Feb 24, 2020"

"On a recent trip to NYC I had a chance to enjoy my first dining experience at Fogo de Chao. The ambiance, food selection and overall presentation were great and I ceratinly walked away both impressed and quite full / satisfied.To start, their salad bar was awesome. Not only were there plenty of fresh vegetables, there was a nice selection of gourmet cheeses and cured meats. It was probably one of the best salad bars I have seen. For the meal itself...man oh man, so many delicious options brought right to your table side. My favorites were the lamb, bacon wrapped filet and the chorizo. The different meats were cooked perfectly and full of flavor.The only reason I can't give them a full 5 stars is because when the group I was with ordered our drinks they seemed to be out of every beer we tried to order and had to settle on a lesser alternative. Also while there was plenty of meat options, it seemed like some didn't come out as much / frequently as we hoped and service would get just a little bit slow at times.This was definitely a very worthwhile, delicious and fulfilling dinner in the Big Apple. I don't get into the city very often but I was happy this time around I had a chance to experience this place.",4.0,"May 4, 2015"

"We went during restaurant week ($38 for the full menu minus the really pricey cuts) with the intention of eating ourselves silly.My conclusion: do not do this.  We left feeling like we ate approximately 4 concrete bricks each.  Instead, pace yourself and enjoy a very attentive staff and very decent steak.  The meat served for the restaurant week goers ranges from incredibly tender to a bit overdone and chewy- what you get is kind of luck of draw, so keep an eye out for waitstaff carrying fresh-out-of-the-oven, not overdone selections.  The medium-rare, hot carvings are incredibly delicious.  Our favorites were the garlic steak (yes, it's literally slathered in garlic butter) and the picanha.Only con was that their restaurant week menu does not include a gluten-free dessert (celiac in the party), and staff seemed a little annoyed that we were asking in the first place.",4.0,"Aug 7, 2014"

Went there for the first time last week and it was worth the price. Wednesdays are 1/2 price (South American) wine night (on bottles less than $100). I wish we were seated closer to the Market Table (aka buffet) but stock up with all of the veggies and cheese and you should be able to only make 1 trip. They are not stingy with the meats that they bring around to the tables. I appreciate that they brought around meats cooked at all different levels (rare to well-done). The wait staff was friendly. We made a same day reservation on Open Table and did not wait more than 15 minutes to be seated when we arrived.,5.0,"Jan 29, 2018"
"Maybe it was the time of day that we were there 7pm on a weekday but the meat was dry and some of the pan de queso was stale.  The salad bar was very fresh and delicious with a great selection.  As my plate because used and cluttered, nobody offered to replace the plate.  I stacked my daughters used plate with mine on the edge of the table and it took 5 minute for someone to pick them up.  Other Fogo's are very quick about grabbing used items and offering fresh clean plates.  Normally I'm a fan of Fogo in other locations, this one was not worth 5 stars.",3.0,"Jul 11, 2019"
"It was a lucky lucky day when I was invited to attend a yelp elite event here. The experience was great, it's my first time trying a churrascaria. The atmosphere was really nice, perfect for group gatherings or an intimate date or just a celebration over something. I started with the salad bar, it was okay, they have a good variety but didn't see much of my favorites, I preferred their protein section of smoked salmon and what not. The real star here is of course their grilled meats. The servers were great, they were constantly coming in and out with food every second, but you have to grab their attention, they don't necessarily go to every table. I had the fraldinha, picanha, filet mignon, lombo, linguica, frango, and polenta. Their frango is okay, the chicken wasn't really juicy, the lombo was eh as well, I think they're better at making beef because their filet mignon, picanha and fraldinha were great compared to the other meats. I liked the filet mignon best, the picanha was a little too fatty for me. I'm more of a tender meats kind of girl. As for desserts, I had a cheese cake sample platter that featured, strawberry cheese cake, caramel pecan, key lime and chocolate cake. They were okay, very creamy and it reminded me of cheesecake factory. I would only recommend coming here for their grilled beef meats and maybe with a smaller group, in the yelp elite event it was a huge room of people, I think the servers might have been overwhelmed since not everyone got to try everything and my water was never filled the whole night.I'm giving it 3 stars because I didn't love the place, the food is okay but not mind blowing, still worth checking out if you've never had Brazilian food.",3.0,"Nov 16, 2014"

We came for the restaurant week deal.Environment: lighting is intimate, dark but very sociable. Very warm and not too scary. Salad bar: Pretty good variety for this buffet-styled restaurant. I got so much that I overfilled my plate. Meats: waiters come around with meats on swords and the cut is very clean. The sirloin and parmesan pork were my favorite. These were never too salty. The bacon-wrapped chicken and the sausage was on the saltier side. All in all, we all agreed we'd come back again.",5.0,"Aug 20, 2017"

We also received plates of mashed potatoes, plantains, and fried polenta. A nice addition to our meals.As for the meats itself, they were just fantastic. I had to flip my card to red so many times because the waiters came by often and with a different skewer each time! Although I wish I was able to eat every type of meat, my stomach capacity could not take it. But what I did try was just incredible, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Lastly, we had creme brûlée for dessert, which was just a fantastic and delicious end to our meal.Our bill came out to about $97 (including tax, excluding tip)!

"This is really a 3.5 rating. I never really had Brazilian food or steak (I guess in this context) so I don't have anything to compare Fogo de Chao to. I made reservations for 3 at 6pm on a Friday, the last day of restaurant week. Upon arriving, the decor is nice and modern with very high ceilings. The hostess checked in my reservation and directed us downstairs to our table. No wait, though it wasn't to begin with. Because of the high ceiling, the voices will echo, so it was kinda loud. In result, I didn't hear the waiter too well. He explained how to signal the people with the meat to give us meat. (haha). Which is a circular paper that has red on one side and green on the other. He also said the salad bar was also unlimited so, you may get up as many times as you like. Onto the actual food! Salad bar had a nice variety of meats like salami, smoked salmon, pastrami, prosciutto. There was also cheeses, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, beans, pasta, chicken salad, rice and beans, bacon, and much more. I only went once because you're here for the meat and not the fillers, plus there's sides they give you (as part of restaurant week). The sides were fried plantains, polenta, and mashed potatoes. (of course bread was included too, which was delicious). Note: all sides were unlimited too. So all of the sides and stuff from the salad bar was good (except for the bread/crostini from the salad bar was very hard.) After eating so much already, it was time to eat some meat. Though it was hard to hear each person to explain what it was, the first few times, I just said yes to everything. I think it's a hit or miss for some items, but the signature sirloin and NY strip are good. The lamb was also cooked well. The chicken wrapped in bacon was dry. There was one piece of meat that was too salty and I don't remember which one it was, perhaps one of the sirloin (I think there was two types going around).So what I found fascinating was the strolling bar/bar trolley going around the restaurant. Instead of a stationary bar, why not have it go around to each table. Man, the bartender was very keen on selling this pineapple/coconut drink that supposedly help digest meat (or something like that). Though it had me sold because it was different and something to try. It didn't have so much alcohol in it, but it was quite refreshing. The service was okay. The waiter came around and checking in on us and I believe a manager came over to us as well. When I asked for chimichurri sauce, I had to ask twice. Maybe the way it's set up, the waiters doesn't do that? only the busboys/runners? I'm not sure. Overall, it was a nice experience. You will definitely get your fill if everything is unlimited. For an AYCE style of dining AND being a chain restaurant, it had up to par food. The one disappointing thing (especially being perceived as a higher class restaurant), the bathroom floor was SUPER sticky. Fogo de Chao is a nice place for a girls night out, a 3rd date, reunion. It's like business casual sort of ambiance. Nice location too! Because it's near 5th ave and across the street from the MoMa. Not sure if I would come back because it's too expensive for my budget.",3.0,"Apr 8, 2015"
"Fogo de chao is an experienceI never once went to a restaurant that exceeded my expectations as fogo de chao did, that goes to say that I was completely blown away!  Impeccable service along with irresistible food, what could go wrong?Indeed, the plantains and brazillian cheese breads were delicious and a welcome part of our meal.  Indeed, there were a few meats here and there that weren't perfect, but we never glared at when we turned them down, like I said, impeccable service!Fogo de chao must of been the single most impressive dining experience I have ever had, and I highly recommend that you visit for yourself.",5.0,"May 23, 2015"
"It's been years since I've stepped into a Fogo de Chao location (not since I lived in Atlanta in the mid-2000's), but everything was as good as I remembered, in spite of being in different cities.  While FdC isn't my favorite churascaria (my fave being Chima, specifically the Fort Lauderdale location), there is absolutely nothing at all to complain about here.  The concept of a churascaria is the same everywhere regarding the salad bar, the meats, and the small sides delivered to the table, so I won't bore you with those details as there are ample reviews that break it down for you.  I'll just tell you that I base my rating on the quality of the food and service, and I omit the salad bar (c'mon you don't come here just to eat f'ing salad and those who do are lame, unless you are a vegetarian).Based on the number of cuts they serve, it's impossible for me to even begin to describe each one, however, the bacon wrapped filet and lamb chops were especially memorable on this visit.  The service was excellent -- The gauchos were attentive and bombarded us with meat when the coins were flipped green.The other things I like here are the Pao de Queijo (cheese bread) and the papaya cream dessert.  This is a common dessert, found at nearly every Brazilian steakhouse.  It is light and refreshing...  The perfect compliment to end such a heavy meal!  It's something I always complete my meal with.While the prices aren't cheap ($40 lunch/$60 dinner), just remember that NO churascaria is cheap.  The prices at Fogo de Chao are in line with the competition around the country, and remember it's AYCE for heaven's sake!",4.0,"Apr 20, 2014"

So I asked to change my seat idek why cause it's not like the bugs just stay in one spot but whatever I felt more comfortable ‍ waitress was visibly irritated to move things over (literally like 2 tables over) but it's an annoyance so I get that.

As for the food (that I actually ate) meats were completely bland and tasteless..potatoes were good and the salad bar had nice options. Won't be going back tho.

"In a sea of Brazilian churrascaria restaurants, where they carve the meat off swords at your table until your eyes pop out, this chain is by far the best, beating Texas De Brazil hands down.  The service is first class, their sides are tempting enough to fill you up before the star of the show, the meat, but try to avoid them. This one is massive, in a beautiful sub-street space with elegant wood walls and exceptional decor. They have a bar on ground floor and the restaurant below. The bar mixes a wicked mojito, which many New York bars screw up and a bad ass caipirinha, the mojito's Brazilian cousin. Pricey but they deliver value for the dollar.",5.0,"Jul 1, 2014"
"I've never been one to complain about bad service at a restaurant, nor have I ever left a review, but my experience here was by far the worst. It wasn't due to the lack of service provided by the restaurant it was more so about how the staff at the restaurant made me and my gf feel. Me and my gf didn't order the full experience where you get unlimited meat etc. We decided to order a prime rib and filet, once we placed our orders for that, the staffs service completely changed towards us. The manager would come visit every table around us except ours. I began to notice one thing in common was that the surrounding tables were ordering the full experience. Our waitress had a condescending tone once we asked her about ordering steak for ourselves instead of the full experience. I've been to many steak houses, but never have I felt more out of place, and a sense of not belonging than I have at this fogo de chao.

This was one of those.I used to be a server and I can spot that service from across the room.  But still, it was good. We were able to take advantage of the summer special so for $25 it was a smorgasbord of meat and the amazing salad bar. I've been to many a buffets and this one was by far the best. The salad bar had really fantastic choices. For example: arugula salad, spinach, artichoke hearts, bocconcini, charcuterie, pickled veggies, fresh veggies, cheeses, kale salads, beets, and much more. When your card is flipped to the green side the servers just keep coming to your table with different meat for you to try. And then there are sides. We had plantain, mashed potatoes and fried polenta rectangles. I can't remember all the different types of meat, but there were many. And then dessert was included!! Ugh. Just go there, eat well and get your money's worth. I may go again before my trip is over. My friend claims the first server was being snide and was shaming us for having two plates going (one salad bar and one meat). Um, hello, it's a fucking buffet. Relax, buddy,  it was two plates.

"This is a big all-you-can-eat Brazilian steak joint in midtown.I've always been a fan of these types of places because you get to sample a great variety of meats to whatever extent that you want. This place offered about 11 or 12 different items.A few different awesome things, like suckling pig, sometimes show up at other places that do Rodizio Churrascaria as well.The idea is pretty simple. Start off at the salad bar, which is typically amazing by itself. I've seen some places offer sushi there as well. I usually go with the smoked salmon, cured meats and hearts of palm right off. This joint had some decent selections (though no sushi):The salmon was amazing. So once you have had your fill of salad, you flip your little circular card over to the green side (as opposed to red), and then the meat guys start coming around:Each diner is equipped with a small pair of tongs to grab the slices of meat as they are carved off the skewers by the swordsmen. Then you start making piles of delicious meat on your plate. Dig in!Above you'll see a little roasted drumette piece of chicken. This was actually my favorite thing they served. So fucking good. There was a lot of different preparations of sirloin, but I think my favorite of the beef was the bottom sirloin, which is pictured just above, next to the lamb chop.Don't forget to slam a beer; shit is salty and you will get thirsty:The sides are free (the meal is a set price) and also ""all-you-can-eat."" Here, you'll want to stick with the caramelized bananas and fried polenta.The mashed potatoes sucked. They were dry and chalky.Save a little bit of room for dessert too, because this shit is pretty good. I had a delicious slice of key lime pie, but they also have flan, creme brûlée, passion fruit mousse, and lava cake with ice cream.Afterwards, the dessert booze cart comes around, along with the bill, of course:",4.0,"Jun 8, 2015"
"NYC Restaurant Week + $25 for lunch at Fogo de Chao = making a reservation at OpenTable as fast as I can!Decor was very elegant (expected being a midtown NYC restaurant).Service was superb with the servers always walking around making sure you are satisfied.  The gaucho servers were all very friendly and more than gracious in cutting nicely portioned slices of the delicious meats.Salad bar was nicely apportioned, and of note was the quinoa salad and fresh mozzarella which I believe was actually burrata (buffalo) mozzarella, but I did not come here for salad and cheese....My opinion of the meats:- The Picanha was some of the best I've had at a Brazilian restaurant with a thin superbly seared & seasoned sinful fat cap that made the tender medium rare beef an afterthought.- Alcatra was tasty, but I would rather have my top sirloin fattier, so IMO try it but get the Picanha.- Fraldinha was such a nice contrast to the Picanha as it was much leaner and had a much more robust beef flavor.  Kudos to the chefs/cooks as despite being a leaner cut the Fraldinha was still very moist and tender.- Cordeiro (only lamb leg for restaurant week) was good, just a hint of gaminess, but a tad lean for me (may have been slightly overcooked).- Frango I did not try.- Costela de Porco I had mixed opinions as being used to the American style of pork ribs which is sweet and heavily seasoned vs. the Brazilian simply seasoning of salt & pepper I'm in the opinion pork needs the assistance of more seasoning in contrast to beef.  Nonetheless the ribs were nicely cooked and moist.- Lombo was the only letdown as the parmesan crust was a bit heavy and salty.- Linguica was great, nice pork flavor, just enough fat, and juicy.Dessert was the chocolate mousse cake and it was good.FYI: Try the Guaraná Antarctica soda, it was very refreshing and helped settle my stomach.",4.0,"Aug 1, 2014"

"Outstanding Brazilian Steakhouse, some of the best cuts of meat I've ever had. The salad bar has just about everything you can think of, and the red/green chip they give you to alert the staff whether or not you would like more of their meats is simply ingenious!

"This place is just ridiculous. The staff is incredibly attentive - so much so, that even though I made the preemptive trip to the salad bar, I could barely get to any 'greens' before the parade-o-meat began. From bacon-wrapped chicken or sausage to succulent filet mignon, it was all great. All the sides were good, especially the cheese biscuits/rolls. With a couple bottles of wine in a group of 8 or so, came out to about $100/per...rather acceptable given the amount and quality of the food. Would definitely recommend.",5.0,"Feb 7, 2015"
"Save your hard earned money and go to a real restaurant. For a restaurant whose sole focus is high quality meat, the meat quality was embarrassingly bad. The Picanha was the only cut that was edible and I use the term fairly loosely. The whole meal was so disappointing I just gave up and am sadly going to be leaving hungry. That says a lot for a place that's all you can eat. I believe I deserve a refund. On top of that the waitress just informed me that there are no refills for my Diet Coke. Who do they think they are at Fogo? I am embarrassed I even came here. I will probably never admit to eating here amongst people who know even the slightest about good food.

"After trying Fogo for the first time in Philly - I was in LOVE. I've been meaning to go back but haven't gotten a chance to... so you can probably imagine my excitement when I serendipitously stumbled across this place on my way back home from work one day.What's to love:- The experience of having unlimited QUALITY meats with EXCELLENT service- Each server who brings around the different meats grilled it themselves .. that's why they know exactly where to slice for your liking- Their sides - as carby, filling and irresistible as they are - the cheesy bread trumps them all. I was so obsessed with their cheesy bread that I asked if they are served at the bar or if I can purchase them for takeout (but sadly the answer was no)Yes, it is expensive. And I would say that for most people, going to a regular steakhouse and getting yourself a $50 16oz medium rare ribeye would suffice. BUT - I would recommend this place to anybody without hesitation simply because when I'm there, I feel like a kid going to Disney World for the first time.",5.0,"Aug 20, 2014"

"Where to begin with our trip to Fogo?  I was 6 minutes late walking in the door after my reservation time, and was greeted and seated, only to receive a call on my cell that they were going to be giving my table away to someone else.  As I look around at a nearly empty restaurant, I have to wonder what is going through their heads.  There are two things that are causing me to give them 1 star.  The first would be the fact that we were not served the full menu of meats.  I do not know if this is because we came an hour before they closed, but my favorite, the Lombo, was not served at all.  This is extremely disappointing considering we are paying $60 per person.  I mentioned something to one of the servers, and they never bought any out.The next thing I would not come back because of is the Beef Ribs.  Not only were they bland, and completely not seasoned, but they were incredibly tough and not even edible.  The salad bar was nothing to sneeze at (no pun intended), however, I did find some edible things.",1.0,"May 29, 2014"

"Without going into too many specifics about who, your staff is clearly unhappy here (except the upstairs bartender, who was the friendliest person in the entire building). The hostess didn't acknowledge us when we walked in, before walking away to look into another matter. I have no idea what we did to our waiter, but he was just barely feigning being polite. In fact for some reason, we had 2 different waiters at one point, each asking if we needed another glass of wine. When we asked for the check, there had been a large table of about 10 seated right behind, and I guess he was more interested in the tips from that group. He literally came up behind my girlfriend's back, place the check on the table over her shoulder and rushed away without saying thank you, or anything for that matter. We looked at each other in confusion at the curt behavior. I can only presume that this is a common problem because the manager came over 2 different times and not only asked how everything was, but specifically mentioned, ""...is the service ok?"" Until that last thing with the check, it wasn't great, but nothing worth mentioning, so we didn't say anything. It's an odd question to ask guests, btw. It puts us in an awkward position to have to point out what's wrong, in front of your staff, mid-meal. Service aside, we were a bit disappointed by the salad bar - which was just that, a plain old salad bar, reminiscent of Sizzler. The feijoada (which we applaud you for making daily) had a good smoky flavor to it, but ironically, no meat. The pão de queijo was warm but hard, so it almost felt like a buttered roll? The churrasco was well salted with good flavor, but half the time I asked for medium rare, I was sliced off a piece that was medium well (that's a pretty big difference). So clearly, this was a miss, guys.Como brasileira, eu achei que levar meu namorado em uma churrascaria brasileira seria um otimo presente de aniversario. Infelizmente, me arrenpendi de ter levado ele ao Fogo de Chão. De todas as pessoas que nós interagimos, só o Bartender foi genuinamente amigável com a gente. O nosso garçon estava mais preocupado com a gorjeta ele ia ganhar da mesa de 10 pessoas sentadas logo atrás da nossa. A comida do salad bar estava pela metade nas bandejas e a feijoada nao tinha pedaços porco dentro. O pao de queijo parecia que nao foi assado no mesmo dia.

"In an effort to be fair, the food is pretty good. And the service is pretty good at the tables. I ate here for lunch when they opened and tried one of everything. It's pricey but all Brazilian steakhouses are so that is to be expected. This one is definitely nicer in terms of decor and the enormous dining room is a sight to behold.I've also been to the upstairs bar around a dozen times for various functions. Some with food, some without. And I officially declare it the worst bar scene in all of Manhattan. It is expensive, terribly slow service (usually only 1 bartender), and the beer selection is random bottles only from a tin tub behind the bar. It's like grabbing whatever beer is leftover at a backyard bbq out of the cooler, and paying $10 for it. They use sugar packets in the capirinha - not exactly authentic. No TV's, not even a temporary one for march madness. No music. No soul.",2.0,"Mar 20, 2015"
"I'm really glad I came here for their restaurant week during lunch!!  For just $25, we got to try 10 meats (not the famous filet mignon bacon, but I can live with that), their salad bar and dessert (we opted for the key lime pie).Their salad bar was the best ever-I really loved it!!!  They had some mac 'n cheese, potato salad, spinach, quinoa, tomatoes, etccc just trust me when I say that it was tasty!  They also gave us some sides, including mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas.  Oh, and the bread they gave was SO delicious!!  They were nice 'n airy and all that jazz.As for the meat, it was pretty fatty and salty.  I could only take a few bites of each one, but I guess that's the point, right?

Really good and high quality steak (but of course not the best given you can eat unlimitedly).

However food came out quick. & it was non stop pleasure. I ordered a $50 dollar bottle of red wine & was good to go. You should be picky as for the meat you want because if not you will be full by the 4th or 5th turn.

"Fogo de Chão has great service and offers a fun / interesting dining experience (my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse).  However, as a meal option, it wasn't up my alley, and I probably wouldn't return (for the food, at least).As other reviewers have mentioned, the set up is a fancy buffet with a salad bar and waiters walking around with various cuts of meat. Highlights for me included: cured salmon, fresh mozzarella, and pineapple from the salad bar; the house cut (Picanha), Beef Ancho, and Alcatra from the meats. Oh, and the cheese bread -- the cheese bread was very, very good.However, my main qualm with the meal is that while I appreciated the variety, and the various meat cuts seemed solid with nice seasoning... it didn't feel like I tasted anything above ""good"" ('cept for the cheese bread). While the price ($60pp) was a great deal for the quantity / variety offered, I would have preferred one falling-off-the-bones tender piece of lamb or a nice, juicy medium rare cut of filet mignon. Given the Brazilian steakhouse format, I'm not sure if that's possible (or what they're aiming for). Nothing against the restaurant -- I'm probably just not well suited for this format.We ordered the flan and key lime pie for dessert -- I would advise skipping these. Flan was overly sweet, key lime pie was a bit too sour.Interesting bit: I came here for Valentine's Day dinner. At the end, the servers gave us a gift card for a complimentary lunch/dinner at a later date. Not sure why they would throw this perk in, as it's a very generous offer, but the card definitely stretches out one's bang for the buck.",3.0,"Feb 14, 2015"

Going to Fogo de Chao is like playing red light /green light CARNIVORE style!!! The picanha (top sirloin in a light garlic seasoning) was the epitome of deliciousness.

"Came here for Restaurant Week dinner.  Overall, the service is friendly, but incredibly slow and inefficient.  If you get a side table, be prepared to have to active track down servers for cuts of meat and even for water.  Food is good, but I  don't know if I would pay the standard $60 for dinner... I came here with a large group of friends.  We had an 8pm reservation for 8 people and when I called to make it larger, I was informed that due to restaurant week, they could not allow for a larger reservation. Boo :(We all ordered the RW menu (you could also have the option of ordering from the full menu), which is slightly limited (no filet mignon) but a good deal at $38pp.  The salad bar had a nice variety of things to pick from.  Smoked salmon, proscuitto, hearts of palm, asparagus, quinoa salad with edamame, grilled eggplant, manchego cheese, and some large balls of mozzarella? Burrata? Among other things.Once we were ready for the meat, service wasn't very attentive.  We had to actively try to flag down servers and sometimes as the bus boys to send certain things over to us, since we kept getting chicken and sausage, but we wanted ribs or lamb.  We were brought hot side dishes, which included fried bananas (love! also they were more caramelized than crispy, but very tasty nonetheless), crispy polenta (pretty salty), and garlic mashed potatoes (not that garlicky).  There are also these very light and fluffy cheese popovers, which were very light in cheese flavor.  I really liked them, and I don't like cheese.  On the other hand, my husband the cheese lover thought that they were too mild.  Almost everyone at the table enjoyed them though.I LOVED the ribs and I really liked the lamb.  Most of the cuts of meat were fairly rare, but you could ask for sections / pieces that were more well done.  The garlicky sausage was also quite tasty.  I wasn't as fond of the different cuts of sirloin.Dessert was okay. We were given a choice of 3 options.  The chocolate mousse cake was the best, although it was very generic, like supermarket chocolate cake.  The cheesecake was heavy and too sweet.  The key lime pie was warm (which makes it decidedly less apppetizing) and very tart.We left feeling very VERY full, and generally happy with our meal, but we all agreed that it was annoying to continuously have to try to flag down meat servers who were ignoring us.  We also had to ask for water several times when our glasses weren't being refilled, and then we had to wait quite a while for someone to bring us the check too.",3.0,"Aug 9, 2014"

"I was very excited to try this restaurant but it did not meet my expectations. The reservation process was smooth and simple. I barely waited a minute before I was seated. The first time I noticed as I descended the stairs was that the waiter did not bother to even say anything to my party. The atmosphere is impressive. The seating arrangement are very close. Some of the staff had trouble navigating between tables. Our main waiter did not explain the menu to us. He just asked us what we would like to drink and if we were there for restaurant week. When we said we weren't, he just left. So we got started on the salad bar. The salad bar is modest. Some items were better than others. As more people filled the lower level, the smoked salmon was mostly always out. The meats were just okay. They looked delicious but tasted a bit bland. My table would always get the pieces that had the large pieces of sea salt. If we didn't, we had extremely bland meat. The lamb was inedible in some instances. The guy with the lamb chops did not understand that when we flip over our card to red that we don't want anything. But he would still come over and ask and push us to take it. My party was seated close to the back near the kitchen. Once the front of the floor began to fill, we no longer got the meats even if our cards were flipped to green. But we did get a good hour of service before we were forgotten. My table didn't get our sides until 45 minutes into service. I would see other tables receive theirs upon seating. That inconsistency was annoying. The service we received from various staff members was not good. No one was happy or even pretended to be. They were all annoyed except for the meat guys. We had to ask where the bathroom was and we were just directed to the middle of the room. I eventually found it. When it was time to leave, it took forever for our check to arrive. When it did arrive, it was wrong and they charged us for something we didn't order. The waitress who took our check didn't seem surprised by this when we brought it to her attention. The correct check took a while to arrive as well. As expected, once they came over to take our card, it actually took even longer for them to bring it back. I'm not sure how this is possible as I saw other tables receive their checks and pay very quickly. However, I did see many tables dispute their checks earlier during my time there. I didn't think it was a common occurrence. But it is. I had my experience and I'm never going back. Lunch has the same meats as dinner. If you can make it to lunch, do it. Otherwise, it's really not worth it.",3.0,"Aug 21, 2016"
"I bit disappointed on the service. We had different servers through out the night, lack of consistency. Due to this matter, we ordered desserts and coffee with a waiter, then few minutes after that, another waiter (new) dropped the checked (no desserts yet or coffee). After 20-25 mins we care to ask for it, and they forgot. We needed to provide the order again, as this was never sent to prep in the kitchen. From the management perspective, not sure how effective this could be: Having so many servers and none sounded like the server in charge of our table. I hope this could be improved. So far, no interested to come back.Chris",3.0,"Sep 19, 2014"

This spot is MASSIVE and bodes well for bigger group outings.You get a full salad bar and an assortment of 15 or so different styles of chicken, meat, sausage and whatever else you can think of when you are ready to go.  Sides were also good, we did the garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and fried plantains.  The only thing I don't like here is that you get attacked from all angles with different meats and conversations seem to get interrupted when the servers come by.  Granted, that is the style of restaurant but it was still fun nonetheless and worthy of a shot.",3.0,"Jul 28, 2014"
"One of the finest Brazilian places in NY! Meat lovers will be exhilarated because they have almost kind of meat the way you want it cooked. The choices are just never ending, from steaks to BBQ, chicken, pork, beef, lamb, sausage etc. it's all about protein. Just the way I like it.",5.0,"Jun 25, 2017"
"My experience was nothing short of amazing.I really do appreciate good service so I'll go into full detail. A party of two, was seated very promptly during the busy dinner time with no prior reservations. We were walked down to our seat and was brought our beverages right away (I went for a different cab sav, but should have stuck with J Lohr). My phone was low on battery, and I happen to have it readily available in my pockets since I am out of town.. I asked the server if he was able to charge it for me, which he obliged to. The unlimited salads at the salad bar was pretty amazing, but you should save your stomach room for all the meat! .. Eduardo and Eric, the servers, were awesome!! They both came by often and asked how we were, asked what kind of meat we wanted, the cut we wanted and made sure we were attended to the whole night (they came and made sure I had nice rare filet mignon cuts ). Although the food was what you would consider ""fine dining"", the experience was more than worth it, and the service was amazing. The decor is very nice inside the restaurant and has a very nice bar on the second and third floor. Highly recommended!! If you are the manager and the this, please send off my thanks and regards to Eduardo and Eric!",5.0,"Mar 8, 2017"

The salad bar was great but honestly with all the sides they bring out I could do without it. The meats were all delicious, we were with a large party so they let us have the private room which was SO NICE! The lamb chops and top sirloin were so good! I didn't have any drinks but some of my dinner mates did and they all said they were good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, I think the price was worth it and I would definitely go again.",5.0,"Mar 19, 2014"

"Absolutely wonderful experience, we would definitely come here over and over again. It is absolutely true that Fogo serves you Brazilian bbq to your heart's content. The waiters came around one after the other with so much deliciously charred steak, chicken, pork, lamb - it was almost impossible to say no. There were very few moments where my plate was empty, Fogo doesn't seem to be the type of place to keep you waiting for food. A must-go if you're a proud carnivore who enjoys novel experiences. Just remember to prep your stomach appropriately prior to your meal, this deliciousness does not come easy on your body.",4.0,"Mar 1, 2015"
"Took my fiancé here for her college graduation dinner, first off this place is very pricey but I knew this going into it so it was expected,  but besides the price this place is phenomenal!  If you don't know how it works, there is a round card by each plate, one side red one side green, as long as you have it on the green side they keep coming by with huge slabs of different meats and cutting off pieces for you, and the meats are TOP quality, you have your steaks, chicken, pork, lamb, sausage,  all equally mouth watering and seasoned to absolute perfection,  once you look 5 months pregnant you can turn your card to the red side and take a break or be done.The drinks are also amazing and made to perfection. Bottom line if you love meat and tasty drinks and have a special occasion I'd definitely make reservations and come here.",5.0,"Jun 15, 2015"
"Among Brazilian steakhouses in New York City this is probably my favorite. The salad bar is quite good well stocked with a variety of vegetables, salads and dressings. The waiter was a total professional, coming up to the table only as necessary, and not overdoing it with the is ""everything okay ma'am"" and ""how is everything tasting"". As for the Radizio itself, the beef ribs and top sirloin were my absolute favorite. Everything was cooked to medium, perfectly pink and juicy.  We did go for dessert at the end, finishing off our meal with creme brulee which was finger-licking good. This meal was also priced very well given the quality of the meat, the selection and the all you can eat nature of the restaurant. The only thing we were missing was grilled pineapple. This is definitely one of our favorite things to eat at a Brazilian Rodizio, and unfortunately this one did not have it included.",5.0,"Jun 14, 2017"
"I went here for a best friends bday along with 5 other girls. We heard good reviews so decided to try it. I made reservations on open table and called to confirm. We arrived on time and got seated within a few minutes. The wait staff is super nice and friendly. We were taken downstairs to a large dining area which looked really nice. We got all types of salads at the salad bar. The Parmesan kale salad was good; also the basil watermelon salad and the tomatoes and mozzarella. I tried a bit of the split pea soup which was decent. When we sat we turned our coasters over and the meat started coming, lol. I thought the best was the sirloin, garlic steak and the bacon wrapped chicken (minus the bacon). The cuts were nice and tender. Very good. I also tried the lamb chops which were ok too. The best part of my meal though were the pan de queijo balls. They taste so yummy warm. You know the food at a restaurant is good when no one is talking, lol. We enjoyed tasting the complimentary pineapple cachaça; and the birthday girl ordered the mango fresco which she said was very good. We also ordered her a molten cake for dessert and that was pretty tasty as well. The only thing was we didn't realize how expensive it would be and I usually have a groupon or some sort of coupon for places like that, so hence the 4 stars. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars for me but the price was a bit much. I guess I have to come more hungry for it to be worth the price because we only had 1 plate of food. Usually at a buffet I have like 2 or 3, lol; but will definitely be returning at some point. Good experience Fogo de Çhao",4.0,"Jul 17, 2016"
"Maybe the best churrascaria restaurant around.Stunning atmosphere.  I wish most steakhouses looked like this.  The wine cellar (actually upstairs) is beautiful to look at. As to the steak, generally excellent.  The best was the sirloin.  The garlic was very good, but could not seem to get it rare or medium rare.  Excellent lamb chops, but a bit overseasoned.   Super salad bar (even had salmon).  Excellent sides.  Nice warm bread (seemed like a cheese puff).  The service is very good and they are eager to please.  Desserts are pretty good too.Worth a trip, but come hungry.",5.0,"Jul 25, 2014"

"The staff was very friendly and welcoming at the door. Nice atmosphere and the service was excellent. It's a meat lovers Paradise. You must try the lamb, it is tender, lightly seasoned and out of this world. I am not a big meat eater but there are all types of delicious beef. However, the lamb was my favorite and I is highly recommend it. There's a salad bar which is light. I like the polenta which is served at the table. it is very light and crispy. The caramelized banana is also nice. We had a 5:30 reservation and it was a good time. It got crowded later but they don't rush you. Leave room for dessert have the papaya cream it is so mellow and a nice ending to the meal.  Nice evening and great food!",5.0,"Dec 19, 2013"
"Usually not a good sign when all the meats come out well done.  So we were celebrating 2 birthdays and decided not to go to our usual place in Yonkers and went here.  Big mistake.  We should not have ventured out.All the meat was well done.  Nothing was available medium or medium rare for almost 30-45 minutes.  Not cool.  On top of that, one of the saddest salad bars I've ever seen at a Brazilian bbq joint.  I mean, wow it was sad.  Giving this place 2 stars instead of one because the bread was good.  How sad is that?  You get props for good bread.",2.0,"Feb 17, 2015"
"Way over priced for the food/service/ambiance. As a BRAZILIAN living in NYC you expect a great service, a Brazilian style plus great atmosphere and kidness. -We had only a few sides at our table, while in a good Churrascaria you have Rice, Beans, vinagrete, farofa and more. (Did not See any of those at our table)-NO diversity on the salad bar - 4 out of 10-we had to complain 4 times to have an OK service.-we were placed on a table that had no light on top of it! Dark spot, maybe that is why waiters did not see us?- $400+ bill for 4 ppl, - Go to Quality Meats, order a Porter House and a wine and you will be much happier!!!!-fillet mignon was the best part,  I would give a 7 out of 10.

I haven't been to a churrascaria in so long and this met my every expectation. I must first start off with how delicious the cheesy bread was!!! That's enough reason to return for me. The salad bar was pretty extensive - from cheeses to smoked salmon and kale salad (my new favorite food). Then came the good part, the meats! Seasoned so perfectly and cooked to the absolute perfect temperature! It's a meat lovers paradise, especially for those medium rare fans (high five).Okay, drooling a little writing this...",5.0,"Feb 11, 2014"

"I will say this, the restaurant has a great atmosphere and fine lighting within its interior, one would certainly feel important dining in a restaurant such as Fogo De Chao.  That being said, the salad bar needs to have more selections in vegetables, Ruby Tuesday for some reason felt like they had more options to choose from.  First time dining in a Brazilian steakhouse will have to say I enjoyed on how the meat is being served - the green and red pog gives customers the freedom to welcome or hinder from being served.  Although the servers are professional, much prefer them to be more personable with a sense of humor, especially for an upscale restaurant like Fogo.",4.0,"Jan 3, 2015"
"I've been meaning to experience a rodizio style meal. what better excuse than the olympics and restaurant week. came here for restaurant week, which is $29. however, learned that this wouldn't be the full churassco experience, excluding quality cuts like ribeye, beef ribs, and filet mignon, so we opted for the full since it was $39. you can start right away or go to the buffet table. very tasty feijoada (bean stew). I had another churassco later in the week, so this was definitely a quality feijoada in comparison. there's also smoked salmon and capers. pretty decent with the pesto sauce and capers. cheesy bread at table is addictive as well. for $40 they do a good job of coming around with all the cuts, although they don't space out the trips where they bring the meat. in this way, you seem like you living this meat dream, but there is no way you can eat all of it!! I didn't feel that they were trying to skimp in the beginning, but they did slow down gradually. meats are of good quality. they ask you how you like your meat and let you pick where you want it to be cut. would have been fine just eating the house sirloin. lamb is a bit gamey. ribeye and filet are decent but the quality of cut blurs after a while (they seemed a little dry) since you are eating so much red meat. I think it's really hard to get your money's worth. For comparison, you would pay about $50 for a nice ribeye bone-in. I didn't come close to eating a whole steak in this sitting. So you are paying for the ambiance and the experience. The concept is good, but definitely not what I expected. not as fun and not nearly as satisfying. for the $40, we didn't even get dessert even though we paid the $10 to cover the better cuts. they definitely look after the bottom line. waiter got testy after we inquired about the dessert.  after about two hours sitting there, they kept asking us if we were done. couldn't even have a decent conversation with their constant inquiries. come on. there are empty tables everywhere. not sure if i would come  back, but if I did, I would make sure to order a nice glass of cabernet. but just maybe not here.",3.0,"Aug 23, 2016"

"Fogo de Chao is the best place to have a large dinner party in the city. Came here with a party of 17 co-workers with only making a reservation 1-week in advance. The only hiccup is that want everyone in the party to be seated at once so we enjoyed some drinks at the bar upstairs for about 30-min until all 17 arrived.We all really enjoyed the self-serve buffet setup which had tons of great options. For most of the evening i made myself steak salads which was great! The meat is seriously never ending, but the only downside is after a while, they keep on bringing around the same types. I think they may rotate what they cook every few hours as when we first got there they had a different set of meat selections (during the busier time) whereas towards the second half of the dinner we saw some of the more basic meats coming around. I think in total I only tried about 3-4 different types of meat, of which 2 I actually really liked. If you are worried about the price, $60 is a very good deal for the quality of service and ample amount of food. There is def no shortage of food!Would highly recommend not eating all day or just a light breakfast before as you won't get to enjoy all of the offerings!",4.0,"May 13, 2014"

"My friends and I have come here the last two Restaurant Weeks in a row.  The food is really good, but overpriced if you're paying full price. The concept is really cool, the salad bar is killer, and the meats are awesome but you're mainly paying for the experience.  I never care for any of the chicken they serve, and rarely like the pork, but the steaks are always amazing.  I like my meat very rare, and my girlfriend likes hers well done (or ruined as i call it, ha!) so the wait staff was being really awesome and coming to our table first to give her the well done bits, then coming back later when the rare was exposed.   The cheese bread is awesome.  The mashed potatoes, and plantains they keep on the table are both equally amazing. We had cheesecake and key lime pie for desert.  I'm not a desert person but they were included with the deal.  The cheesecake was good but very small (again might have just been a small portion for the deal), and the pie was ok.  The drinks and wines are expensive but they have a happy hour at the bar upstairs.  The place is huge, and beautiful, and its perfect for special events or big groups.  Go on an empty stomach because you will eat waaaaay too much.  Go with fun people because you're going to need to take breaks in between stuffing your face.      Definitely a place to check out if you've got a birthday or want to splurge a bit.",4.0,"Aug 14, 2015"

"I'm a fan, simply because of the -rare- cooked bacon wrapped filet mignons. They're the most amazing piece of beef you can have. Now, the thing is that often they will serve you medium or at best medium rare filet; claiming it is cooked rare. They can do better, and they do that at other Fogo locations. NYC is a special place on earth...The caipirinha at $14 a pop is a bit too expensive - and not quite worth it - but definitely delicious.As for the meats their bottom sirlion, ribeye, etc etc is just absolutely great - and you can get it served however you want. Pro tip is to take it easy on the cheese bread when starting out here, simply to allow you to sample all the meats.Fogo is place I bring all my out of town friends at least once, just because of the dining experience. Due to a few incidents where I've been unhappy with service (only at this NYC location) I may try out another place next time around, but only if I know that my dear Fogo will remain.If you've never tried a churrascaria this is simply an amazing experience, 'nuff said.",4.0,"Mar 9, 2015"

One of the waiters remembered that I liked my meat particularly rare and bloody so he came by with the freshest meats because they wouldn't be as cooked through yet.

"Unfortunately I wasn't able to give it a higher rating due to the service. First off, the food is delicious. The meat selection is good and the temperature is on point.  The salad bar has an extensive selection of fresh plates and worth a whorl before stuffing yourself with delicious meat. The decor is beautiful and intimate. THE SERVICE: I as mentioned in my prior reviews, I have experience in the food service industry. A place with such rave reviews  should also have the service to match the environment. From the moment I walked in, I wasn't too happy. The hostess didn't know A from B. I arrived for a lunch party under a specific name. She indicated that she had no such party but that I should go downstairs to an inaudible room name. I proceeded downstairs and literally wondered around to find a maitre d. ( All of my colleagues shared the same experience upon their arrival) He also was not aware of the lunch party but escorted me to two different rooms to see if I knew anyone. That type of service in my opinion needs to be polished. I understand you are busy and have many things going on but it isn't an excuse. I've worked events with a high volume of guest and I can assure you, if we didn't know where everyone went we found out immediately. For a lunch party of 20+ we were assigned one waitress. Now, I feel that it would have been smarter to assign two; minimum. This waitress never replaced any water. She was asked by various people to bring more water and finally replenished it. The waitress also disappeared for most of the service and didn't clear out plates in a timely manner.  I still had my main course plate when desserts were being served. The dessert itself took a significant amount of time to be brought out. My expectations for a location that is charging premium prices will be at a high standard. This location is not meeting that standard. I have been to similar locations with the same Rodizo serving and hands down the service was better. Very disappointing.",3.0,"Dec 16, 2016"

My only complaint is that when your chip is turned over to green, or essentially ""go"", I feel like the men coming around with the meat are like vultures swarming over dead bodies. It can be pretty overwhelming, so you end up turning your chip to stop and missing things. They need to develop a better system.

The mashed potatoes left much to be desired. The caramelized bananas and fried polenta were good. The dessert was ok but they skimped on the portions for restaurant week diners. The best part of our meal was the cheese bread and the Brazilian limeade. The limeade is $4.50 with free refills. You will definitely want to order one of those- so refreshing!

I tried a little bit of everything, but my favorite was a garlic infused beef. You're given side dishes of bread (looks like some kind of popover?), polenta fries, fried sweet plantains, and mash potatoes - all very good.

The salad bar was a little light, which was ideal for me, fully allowing me to focus on whats important--the meats. Filet mignon wrapped in bacon was expectedly awesome.In terms of decor, the place is huge and impressive, noise ok, and the decor/feeling very new yorkish elegant - not quite Quality Meats, but nice.",5.0,"Dec 17, 2013"

"I must say if they didn't forget to give me their ""famous"" cheese bread, it was possible they could have had a perfect rating :)So I came here for one of my boyfriend's friend's birthday dinner. We arrived an half an hour early to bat traffic and to grab a drink before dinner starts. This is my first Brazilian dining experience. Service: They have amazing service. We were the firsts from the party to check in, we hung out at the bar for a bit. The bartender was super nice and gave us a brief intro to the restaurant since they have locations on the east and west coast, but started in Brazil. I like how the bartender was attentive to everyone who came by. That's the bartender you want when your glass is empty. When we got seated, the people on our table flip to the side that is green, there was a meat cutter waiting for you to take a piece of their delicious meats. But then another waiter had toflip it all back to red becuase we didnt have plates yet. I love how you don't have to wait for anything to order. If you like the product, you just take it!Food: We started our meal at the salad bar. I love how fresh everything is! The fact that they had prosciutto at the salad bar made my day! After we got a few things at the salad bar, the feasting begins. It felt like a meat rush hour at the dinner table because once you flip to the green.side.of the card, it was a swarm.of.meat cutters.waiting to plate you their cuts.  I love medium rare! There was a few cuts that I enjoy as much because it was bot overdone. I enjoyed the sirloin, pork,sausage. filet mignon, chicken leg, lamb shank, and ribeye. But overall, I was pretty happy with the selections.Ambiance:Gorgeous restaurant ! It was so spacious in there. It was modern design with a romantic feel to it. Overall, I would def come back for the cheese bread I miss out on!",4.0,"Feb 24, 2014"

"Made a reservation for 6p.m, got there around 5:50 and was seated very quickly. The space that we were seated was somewhat private and the servers were quite attentive. The salad bar had a decent variety of cheese, salmon, fruits, rice and such. My boyfriend and I got full pretty quickly because we forgot to flip the card back over to red so they always came around with meat within seconds. Around $60+ per person so definitely worth it for meat lovers. The only part that was a bit disappointing was when I instructed the waitress to write happy birthday (name of my BF) on the dessert plate but it only said happy birthday on it. But the chocolate cake was good. Overall a good experience, the space was very nice.",4.0,"Dec 8, 2016"

"Food is amazing. The 3 stars are for service. Our server was not taking care at all, not even for placing the order for drinks. I had to ask for the sides. We asked for a grappa at the end, and when we discover that it was way over priced (32$) we asked if the price was correct. The manager said yes, and because of our ""surprise"" he said that one dessert was complimentary. That was very nice of him, but in the end we paid both the desserts we got and the complimentary one never came. So it was just a trick to appear fair and caring. Disappointing.",2.0,"Mar 8, 2015"

"I'm usually not keen on the all-you-can eat places, but this one is not bad.  The salad bar is well stocked and has a good variety of above average veggies, fruits, and cheeses.  Table served meats are good, not outstanding though.  Most are cooked medium, and by the time they are served they have cooled and dried a bit (unless you sit right by the kitchen).  Meat was slightly under seasoned on average (with some cuts being way under seasoned and some being seasoned properly).  I prefer meats rare to medium rare - I only found one or two cuts that were served that way.  We had to ask for some specific cuts (such as beef ribs) which we were informed by the manager would be out in ""30 seconds"" after asking the waiter and other servers about a dozen times - needless to say the beef ribs were great but took a long time before the ribs were served.  There was a real push by the waiter to upsell wine.   Overall, this is just not my kind of place but I would understand how others would like it. If you like to try a large quantity and variety of various above average meats that are mostly cooked medium, and don't mind the meats being a bit cool and dry by the time it's served, then this is your place.  Personally I prefer a single serving of very high quality meat, cooked exactly the way I like.",3.0,"Aug 25, 2018"

"My experience at Fogo de Chao was definately an one and only experience. I was there for the third time a few days ago and I already want to plan my next visit! This time around was one of the best times, visiting Fogo NYC was definately a wonderful choice I made, no shadow of a doubt. The food was exquisite, the amazing buffet offered many salads, cold cuts, fruits, and many more, as in any other Fogo de Chao. The meats coming around the table non stop and being served at your plate, diferent cuts and types, like lamb, pork, chicken, beef, and unique flavor. The food was savory delicious, fresh, yummy, divine! And adding to the succulent food there was the service. It was perfect, to the point!

"I came here for dinner along with my wife.  Let's get right into it.The meats, by and large, are fine, which is regrettably disappointing considering just how expensive this place is.  I found it strange that I gravitated more towards the sides (like the cheesy bread & mashed potatoes) as well as the market salad bar (I really enjoyed the rice & beans combo available the night I went) more than the actual meats.  The meats were just bland - nothing about their taste knocked me off my feet.  I think that if this were a ""normally"" priced place that I might rate this higher but I just can't at $62/pp.(Side note: it took about 10-15 minutes to get another order of the cheesy bread, and the staff mistakenly charged 2 extra beverages to my order so be warned!)I passed on the dessert as I hadn't heard great things prior.  I most likely won't be coming back.",3.0,"Feb 20, 2017"

Their salad bar is great with many selections. I really enjoyed their quinoa, asparagus, peppers, eggplant, and green beans. What I also loved is their cheese balls! Actually I think they are called cheese bread (the round bread at your table). After I found out it was gluten-free, I had about 5 of them...whoops! They also bring out some side dishes to your table, but my favorite one was the mashed potatoes!Now to the MEAT! I loved the chicken leg (very juicy and flavorful), the ribs, lamb, either the top or bottom sirloin, and the garlic steak! Pretty much everything was good, but the chicken wrapped in bacon was a bit dry and some meats (the outside pieces) were a bit too salty for my taste.Great food and excellent service!

"Oh man was this meal good!! I would give them 6 stars if I could.    From the ambiance all the way to dessert this place was aces. This beautiful restaurant does not look like other steak houses you walk into in Manhattan.    The wait staff was attentive, quick, and complimentary. Our waitress in particular was very nice and charming.    Salad bar was fairly extensive. Everything I had was good quality.  Drinks were presented beautifully. Some of my friends got drinks that came in a whole pine Apple. I'm not sure how to say ponchucatu (the bread) when you sit down was delicious. Soft and chewy.   Once the meats come out you realize how great this dining experience really is. Cut after cut of beef are more tender an juicy than you could have hoped for.  Chicken, pork, sausage, and other following meat were no let downs.   Dessert was nothing special, but they were still good.   I could not believe how good all the food was.

We won't come back any time soon and give them some time to call improve the quality of the food. It feels like a chip buffet in the middle of NYC.

I'm not sure whether to give it 1 star for blatantly being discriminated against or 5 stars for the experience. So I'll start the review and see what outweighs what. I work a white collar job and dress up fancy. This is a fancy place. My colleagues wanted to do dinner here and I said why not-  but I didn't dress up. So I appear in my Yankee fitted and sneakers because I'm off that day and walk in there with my gf and homie. Yes homie. We got there before my colleagues.  We were going to be a party of 7 and the hostess said that the wait for us would be 2 hours. Unbeknownst to the hostess - my colleagues were all white and white professional looking that night. Two of them were Brazilians. Once everyone got there- the wait went from 2 hours to 30 minutes. Now- I'm not sure if it was my appearance that they took a long hard look at and said 2.5 hours but I believe it was. My homie believed it was. It could be they wanted the whole party there I dunno but it felt funny. The food was great. Salad bar was a notch above what you expect at pizza hut restaurants. The steaks were excellent and the bread was amazing.  The decor and feel was also quite nice. The pricing- which we got restaurant week pricing for was adequate. All-in-all the culinary part of the experience was great. The service was great. The lady running around with that fresh piña colada was awesome. Waitress was cool and pretty cute. 5/5 for service3.5/5 for food 4/5 for atmosphereWas I a victim of profiling? I think I was. I felt like I was because I didn't look the part of fine dining diner. They allowed other parties to get in ahead of mine that looked the part. Guess a Yankee fitted is too gangster for this place.

The polenta sticks were awesome and crispy. The salad bar has lots of very, very fresh food. Vegetarians will be very happy at this establishment.

"We came here during Restaurant Week but I dont think it really matters because it seeems the 'normal' service is the same.Appetizers are buffet style and really not that great. Not much flavor and just not the greatest 'raw materials'. Some of the cheeses were good I guess but who needs cheese at a steak house.Once you have your plate, these guys with meat come around to serve you. Problem is they often ignore your table (not sure why). Also it happened a few times that they gave meat to 2 of us and then just left (although one more person clearly also wanted from the same meat). We were 4 in total...not that overwhelming. We did a lot of meat sharing to make sure everyone got to taste everything but really shouldnt be needed in my opinion. Meat was good but you get only small amounts. A real steakhouse is better value for money. Dessert was a mediocre (small) slice of cake. We are not coming back.",3.0,"Aug 20, 2016"

"Fogo was suggested to me by a friend, and I  decided to have my 30th birthday dinner there. I contacted the special events team to reserve a private dining room. The coordinator Debbie got back to me quickly and provided me with the package details and told me that everything was set and the room was reserved! 4 days before my dinner I stopped by the location to check out my room. Nobody knew anything about my reservation and the coordinator Debbie said she never reserved a room for me because I had to sign a contract and provide my Card for an 1100 dollar food and drink minimum. None of this was ever once mentioned to me, and I had the email and text correspondence to prove it. Luckily the room had not been booked and I was able to sign the contract just days before my party! Anderson the manager was wonderful at tying up all the loose ends for me and working out the details of the contract. He was present the night of my party and everything went off without a hitch! My guests enjoyed the food and ambiance. My dinner was from 8-10 and they let us stay almost an hour over the time with no complaint of extra charge. Unfortunately I feel like the event coordinator isn't too concerned with small parties and caters to larger corporate bookings. My 2000 bill was small change to her and it certainly felt that way. Personally I would have liked to have had a face to face meeting so that the coordinator could help me make the best use of the restaurant. For example my dining room had a flat screen display. I wish that it was communicated to me that I could use the screen, and perhaps played a slide show or something to make my event more special.2 stars for the planning...I wouldn't suggest a friend to have a large party here.

"This spot in W 53rd is pretty great in terms of the place with the hours of it including the happy hours bit for booze.  When I hit the place I had a hour to kill before the meal so I hit the bar & chatted the fat with the bartender with my water & also looked at the bit & they got the booze the stock including the high-end spirits for the ""ballers"" for that & if some want to ""floss the ice"" & even for simple beverages to boot & note they got themselves two bars in the place so you're wet feel if you wish will be great but their patio is great especially for doing the happy hour even on great days weather wise.  Now for the actual meal is this.  They do really good for their style of things-you get a marker for telling the staff you're ready for the meats but prior to the main deals you can get some cold stuff for like greens or salads or corn & legumes or what-not & they give you also some rolls so you get yours for that.  For the main stuff you get tongs so when you get the meats to you they cut the portions including the temps for meat temps I was more referring so you get your desired meats with taste or what you prefer for your own meals & let me tell you they do beef/chicken/pork/lamb but if there's one damn thing I got to say & if their crew sees this I hope this is a tip-don't swarm guys with the meats so fast you get inadvertent problems with the people to eat & not worry about them getting sick due to this.  Now they also got potatoes & plantains to go since that's a staple for Brazil anyway & they do offer cocktails/coffee/soft beverages/desserts but you must go your own in terms of your taste but all in all you get your money's worth clearly as you see with this report.",5.0,"Jun 7, 2016"

The servers each carry around a different cut/preparation of meat. If you flip the card on your table to the green side, they will come to ask if you want or not.

"I love meat, and steakhouses, so when i saw Fogo de Chao on the RW list, I knew I had to come here! Came here for Restaurant Week dinner with my boyfriend. The entrance is a bit nondescript, and we both almost missed it as we were walking down 53rd St. Upon arrival, they lost/couldn't find our reservation. However, they were still able to seat us, so that worked out. The restaurant looks pretty huge, with a lot of tables laid out. As part of the RW menu, we were only given about 8 different options for meats (whereas the regular menu had about 12 options), which was still plenty of food. They do give you a coaster to signal if you want food or not (red means stop, green means go!). The gauchos ask how you want the meat cooked, and it seemed like they mainly had medium rare or well done. I had requested the lamb be medium, and he said he was going to come back, but he never did (sad face). However, I was able to try my boyfriend's piece, and it was super delicious.All the meats we tried were pretty tasty, but my favorites were the beef. They meat is pretty free flowing. They also have an unlimited salad bar (which I skipped out on, more room for meat please!), and 3 appetizers: fried banana/plantains, which were delicious, polenta, and mashed potatoes. They also had a basket of cheesy bread, which my boyfriend and I both loved. More of that too, please!We were pretty stuffed at the end of the meal, but made sure to make room for dessert. I had the cheesecake, while my boyfriend had the chocolate mousse. They were decent, although like another reviewer said, it would have been better with a sauce. $38 per person for the RW menu.  The restaurant does try to be a little fancier than you expect (our server busted out the crumb knife as he was cleaning our table), but overall a good experience. Definitely come here hungry!",4.0,"Aug 12, 2014"
Not even close to the stake houses in NJ. Over seasoned no salt or pepper on table and when asked for they brought McDonald packets. I guess that's what you can expect from a chain gone wild. There are too many good places to make this out of the way place worth returning to. The best cut of meat was like rubber and only came past once. The salad bar was better than the meats.,3.0,"Dec 27, 2016"

All the reviews have been glowing. We were there last night with a group of 11 people.  Place was CHAOS.  When we made reservation we specifically said we don't want to be near the kitchen.  They crammed us in a corner right near the kitchen.  When we complained they said it was the gaucho runway.  Whatever that is.  They finally moved us.  This place is not conducive for large groups couldn't hear the waiter from the other side.  They tried to push bottles of water wine and drinks. We asked for a cocktail menu and it was only bought to us after almost everybody ordered drinks.  It's clear that they make their money in this area.  Drinks were just okay.  Meats of course were tasty and plentiful.  Our group thought that desert was included in the price so ordered it even though we really didn't need it after consuming all that meat.  The issue here was there wasn't communication from the staff.  Many people in our group were going for the first time.  The $59.95 price became $120.00 which is certainly not worth it.  Do your research on the menu and drinks before going. Place was okay but certainly not worth all those 4&5 stars.,1.0,"Dec 18, 2015"
"Not bad....Came here with a three others this past Tuesday night after a holiday concert.Meat was salty. Sides were fine. Cheddar rolls were good too. I am not a fan of salty food so that was a downer for me. Everyone else at the table loved the food.Hostess is very sweet and kind in taking a walk in. Those ladies work hard at the reception as the place was busy. The wait staff brining the meat around was very good as well. Quick and friendly...However, we had a male waiter to start the evening with but ended with a woman waiter. She had a major attitude and was rude to all of us at the table. When we asked for refills on water, it took her awhile to actually refill.  She was most likely tired from a long and busy day. We still left a 20% tip since it is the holiday season.",4.0,"Dec 10, 2016"
"All-you-can-eat churrascarias are fun. The moscato here was so refreshing that I bought a bottle to continue drinking later that night. The meat is pretty good and very very plentiful. The pao de queijo isn't as good as Rayuela's or Union Sq Coffee Shop's but it was good nonetheless. The salad bar is also good. The plantain and the polenta appetizers were decent. The biggest thing that is missing here is fruits or more importantly, grilled fruits (imagining pineapple). That would just be the best thing here - acidic fruit to offset the fattiness of all the meat. I could barely eat more than a couple plates of meat. Overall, this is just as expensive as any other decent NYC restaurant but you get a lot more in meat portions.",4.0,"May 7, 2014"
"I have dined at other Brazilian Steakhouses before so this was not my first experience. The atmosphere was elegant. For the price, you can't go wrong, especially if you are a meat lover. There was a big selection of meats that the waiters constantly brought to your table. The meat was not salty, with the exception of the bacon wrapped meats. For the most part, every side is cold except for the soup, rice, beans and potatoes. Two downfalls-The cold salad bar selection lacked starches and cold salads. Also, the price for alcoholic beverages were outrageous! We went with a party of eight and our bill was $749.00 without tip. Overall I would dine here again but order tap water.",4.0,"Mar 13, 2017"
Came here for my girlfriend's birthday. I hate to admit that i do eat a lot. The portion here was beyond a lot. I hate to waste food so i finished it. On top of that it comes with an all you can eat salad bar and dessert..i left the place extremely full and happy.,4.0,"Dec 7, 2016"

"I've been to Brazilian BBQ before, but this was definitely one of the better ones I've been to. Came here for restaurant week with my family to celebrate a birthday. The salad bar, as far as Brazilian BBQs go, was pretty good but nothing amazing. I did like that they had Kalamata-style olives, and my family appreciated the quinoa. They also had a huge bowl of bacon, which was kinda funny. Tucked on the side they had 3 hot dishes going-- one of which was black beans and another which was scalloped potatoes (I can't recall the third.)The servers and wait staff were all incredibly friendly, polite, charming, and helpful.  Although they did constantly come over and ask how everything was, our water glasses were left neglected-- thus the one star off. We resorted to putting our glasses at the end of the table, and it still took 20 minutes to get it filled. With so much seasoned food, this was kind of a drawback.The meats themselves were amazing. My favorite was the house special, the top sirloin I believe. It is a round circle-like cut and is oh my god amazing. The fat is perfectly rendered and melts in your mouth. The bottom sirloin was my second favorite. I highly recommend these two-- batch after batch, I kept going back.The pork sausage was mediocre, and the chicken (both bacon-wrapped and not) was actually really moist and great-- something that usually falls short at churrascarias that I've been to in the past. The lamb was only brought around once, and honestly it was a bit dry and not as rare as the others, so maybe it was just a bad batch. The parmesan pork was only brought over after an hour or so of sitting there, after all of us had finished.The restaurant week deal also included a dessert: a choice of key-lime pie, cheesecake, or chocolate mousse. I got the cheesecake and it was decent, definitely better than I was expecting.Overall, for restaurant week it was a great deal. I'd be happy to return!",4.0,"Aug 14, 2014"
"I was at Fogo New York a few weeks ago and it was the best experience so far in a Brazilian Steak House. The Salads were delicious to start of. The side dishes like the puffie cheese bread, and the cooked bananas were to die for. The main course, the meats, were cooked to perfection the way I like it. Not to mention the service. Amazing time with family and friends in a beautiful and sofisticated athmosphere.",5.0,"Mar 2, 2019"

"I came here before for a yelp event over a year ago and never forgot about my experience. I was tasked with finding a place for a holiday team dinner and Fogo came to mind right away. This place costs about $60 per person is an AYCE haven for meat lovers. With the AYCE option comes the salad bar which features an assortment of cheeses, cured meats, smoked salmon, veggies, soups, salad and etc. There are over 15+ types of meats that waiters come around with and slice right in front of you. You are given these little place cards on the table (flip green to have the meat come to you, flip red to take a break or stop the flow of meat). My team has never tried Fogo before and they ended up loving the place and saying it was a lot of fun. I would like to thank the floor manager on the night that we went for being so attentive and checking in on us every now and then. The service, and food, met my expectations and I would gladly return here for any special events in the future.",4.0,"Dec 17, 2015"
"It was a very different experience for me. I went there was a group of 5 people. We were treated well by staff. The food was really good. The buffet styled set up was classic; salads, fresh fruits, cheese, breads etc. For dinner I participated in the experience which included different types of meats, chicken, steak, lamb, pork etc. whoever I only enjoyed the chicken and lamb as I do not eat steak. I do wish there was an option for seafood to be apart of the experience but overall it was still well executed.",5.0,"Feb 24, 2019"

Is definitely one of my top 5 places in NY, I'll recommend this place for any special occasion",5.0,"Sep 18, 2015"
"Where do I begin? This place literally has it all. I guarantee that you will be stuffed before you could even finish trying everything that they bring out for you. First off, the cheesy bread is addicting and they definitely keep it coming. Next, you have the salad bar, which is not your typical salad bar. At Brazilian steakhouses like this one, there are cheeses, rice, beans, pastas, plantains, etc. so you are pretty much full with just the ""sides"" before the meat event begins to come out ... so take it easy BECAUSE you don't want to miss that delicious, tender, cooked to perfection meats that they bring out and slide right off the skewer for you. All types of steak, pork chops, chicken, lamb, etc. will keep coming your way as long as your card is flipped on the green side. Towards the end of the meal, I was sharing small portions of meat with my friend just so that I can make sure to try it. I'm quite a picky eater and everything that I tried, I liked so that says a lot. Service is great, ambiance is lovely, price is expensive but well worth it (great quality), and the experience is unforgettable!P.S. The location is great and parking is actually easy on the Westside after 7 PM.",5.0,"Jul 30, 2015"

"the cheese bread that comes warmed in a dish is delicious. i can just sit there and eat that the entire time. the salad bar is decent enough to get started but if you are a meat lover then you will be in heaven. most of the meats are nicely salted, some may be a bit on the salty end but once you flip the card to green the service is constant. almost to a point where your plate piles so high with meat by the time you actually eat it, you're not quite sure which one it was. during restaurant week this is a steal but that's if you can grab a reservation. water is constantly refilled and the sides are as well - sweet plantains, mashed potato, polenta fries. dont forget to get the green chimichurri sauce for the meats. great meal for a treat and experience if you've never had this style before.",4.0,"Apr 3, 2016"
Boys night out!! Food Excellent! Service Excellent! Like all the other reviews before me I agree the bread they have is amazing. There are actually recipes for the bread all over online. I think they put crack in it! It soo good and you just want more. Found the guys coming around with the meat we slow at times. We were waiting on several occasions.

"Went here expecting a nice experience. Was not busy when we entered and we were greeted by unorganized staff. The waiter took us to our table and for a little while it was a really nice experience. The meats were ample and plenty. The servers were the problem.  We were only visited by a server 3 times during our one and half hour dinner. Towards the end of our dinner I asked for a coffee, I never received it (yet I was charged for it). Not only that, I waited 40 minutes to get a check. We sat at an empty table for 40 minutes until I had to manually call another server over for our check. For the price of my check the service is inexcusable. Good food, really crappy service.

"A bit pricier than other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to, but definitely worth the extra you pay. They open the tables at 5:30pm but you can hang out at the bar before that while you wait for your table. The service is crazy here. A server was at our table literally every 45 seconds with a different meat. I had to flip over to red not because I was full, but because I couldn't keep up with how fast these guys were coming. Every meat is perfectly cooked, and they have very few of those random cheap meats that other brazilian places try to pawn off on you to make you full before you get more of the nice meats. Managers are always walking around and making sure diners are comfortable and have whatever they need. They are always more than happy to accommodate any requests for any specific meat you'd like to try again. The salad bar is also really good. They have a huge bowl of bacon strips. Just bacon strips. Don't eat too much from here, though, as good as it is. Also the wine cellar is cool as hell.",5.0,"Jun 29, 2015"
"Not sure why this place has 4 stars because it doesn't deserve it. I've had way better brazilian bbq in Astoria, as well as Churrascaria Plataforma and Texas de Brazil; Fogo de Chao doesn't even compare. The hostess is friendly and the ambiance is 4 stars but I cant say the same about the meats, salad bar or service. First off, they will not seat you until EVERYONE in your group is present; most places will seat the majority of the group but this is not the case here which is very annoying. Second, the salad bar does not have as wide a selection as the other brazilian steakhouses in NYC. Third, we had to flag down some of the servers because the lighting is so dim its easily to miss the green card. Our waiter didnt come by to ask if we needed anything or if everything was ok so service was pretty much non existent. When we were able to flag down servers, the meats were overcooked and under seasoned; most of my medium rare meats were actually well done. As for dessert, I do NOT recommend the chocolate mousse at all! (stick to the key lime or cheesecake) Honestly, I didn't think it was possible to mess up chocolate mousse until now...Entenmann's fudge cake tastes 10x better than the chocolate mousse here. Oh and noise level is unusually high and you have to shout at your guests across the table. Glad I tried Fogo de Chao to see how they compare to the other brazilian steakhouses, but will not be back.",2.0,"Jul 29, 2015"

The lamb was good and I'm not a fan of lamb.The cheesy bread was amazing but don't over eat the sides because there's plenty of meat!The only negative was I asked the waiter who took our drink order that it was my BF's birthday so I asked if they can put ""happy birthday"" on the plate of the cheesecake.

I, myself, was not a fan of the chicken here, but the beef was pretty good - could've been better, but I suspect they save their better cuts for those not dining at restaurant week prices.

We had two vegetarians in the group but they were really happy at how big the salad buffet was. Even if you don't eat beef, you can make a pretty filling meal out of all they offer at the salad bar and I have to remind myself to save room for the meat! Usually when you go to buffets or all-you-can-eat places they load up on the salt so you drink more water and don't eat as much. I didn't find that to be the case here at all.

I would definitely return to relive the amazing dining experience!",5.0,"Feb 16, 2014"

Had an amazing experience at Fogo de Chão. Great cocktails and the waitresses/service staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Definitely a place to splurge on a very empty stomach! Loved the unlimited garlic mashed potatoes and obviously the meat is to die for,5.0,"Apr 15, 2018"
"While I was in the city, I brought along two friends who'd never been to Fogo (or Brazilian more generally).  They loved it just as much as I do.  The food here was as awesome as expected based on general reputation and my experiences at the Addison (Dallas) location.  Everything on the Market Table was fresh and tasty; all the cuts of meat were great - obviously the picanha's always superb, but the fraldinha (flank steak), New York strip, and leg of lamb were surprisingly great as well; I don't remember previously enjoying those as much as I did here.  Of course, there are always a few cuts (filet, linguica, the parmesan pork, the chicken) that I'm just not that into, as a matter of personal taste rather than anything else, but my friends liked them well enough and the nice thing is they have so much variety that there's something for everyone (even if they're a vegetarian...)What set this visit apart was a service detail: when we made our first and only trip to the salad bar, I was disappointed that they didn't appear to have the candied bacon (which I adore.)  I circled around several times looking for it and suggested to my friends that maybe they just didn't have it in NYC and expressed my disappointment about that to them; I'd been talking it up and wanted them to try it.Well, about halfway through our meal, one of the employees (I don't think she was a gaucho but I'm not sure - wish I'd gotten her name to give her a shoutout) walked up to our table bearing a plate of candied bacon.  She told me they'd noticed I was looking for it and that it had just finished being prepared.  This was really impressive as I never actually asked any of the staff about the bacon - I just assumed they didn't have it and filled up my plate with other stuff.  They could easily have not noticed I was looking for the bacon, or bothered bringing it out even if they did notice - we were all fresh-out-of-college-looking-kids in sweaters/t-shirts/shorts/jeans, customers they have no reason to try to impress relative to the usual New York crowd.  And even if the bacon had never made it to our table, I would've walked out of there extremely happy with the experience.  But they went the extra mile to make our visit perfect.  Big kudos to the NYC Fogo team for making my visit on the road as enjoyable as any of my visits to the location at the original Addison location - as much as the foodie in me typically objects to visiting chain restaurants in new cities when I could be trying something I can't find at home, I will definitely be making an exception to that rule for Fogo!   (Disclosure: I'm a small shareholder in FOGO so I'm obviously incentivized to say nice things about the brand.  Of course, independent of valuation, half the reason I own the stock is that it's such a great concept - the food quality, to my palate, is just as good as any prime steakhouse, and you get far more quantity and variety for a lower price.  My friend from CT now wants one in his neighborhood!)",5.0,"Sep 18, 2016"

"I came during restaurant week with a group of three. We had reservations which is a must during restaurant week. The space is beautiful and spacious. The highlights for me:-the bacon from the salad bar. It was incredible. I LOVE bacon!! -the top sirloin was cooked to perfection. I get my meats medium well and this cut was outstanding. It had a wonderful flavor and a nice charred texture.-the mashed potatoes and polenta were very good. We enjoyed them at our table.- the ribs were delicious. Flavorful and cooked to perfection.-the bacon wrapped chicken. As stated before, I LOVE bacon. I also LOVE chicken so the combination was heaven for me. Plus, the chicken was super moist.For dessert I had the chocolate mousse cake which was also very good.I'll be there again for restaurant week!",4.0,"Feb 6, 2016"
"This place is most definitely a carnivores delight! After you are seated you can go up to a buffet bar, where you can fill your plate up with all sorts of salads and veggies. Then you go to your seat where you each individually have little cards that have a red and green side. Red means you don't want meat, green means you are ready. Servers then come around to everyone's tables with different selections of meat and slice it off a huge slab that you take a tong to and tear off. You literally can have all the meat your little heart wants. They also have these rolls that have cheese inside that are crazy addicting. We also tried a non-alcoholic drink called Brazillian Lemonade and it is definitely worth trying. I would make reservations and it is a flat $65/head, but if you have a big appetite and like meat, well worth it!",4.0,"Aug 25, 2016"
"Every time I remember my experience at this Brazilian steak house my mouth waters, it was that good! Okay so the service is on point, when me and my boyfriend  walked in two lovely hostesses welcome us and check us in. Afterwards you go down the beautiful stairs get greeted by a waiter and then seated. Then the fun begins you go to the buffet choose what you want. They had many salads and cheese options, at least I stuck to that because I was more into the delicious cheese bread you get and the mash potatoes with cheese. The steaks all of them were juicy and delicious. Cannot wait to go back.",5.0,"Dec 9, 2015"
"This was a great dinning experience. I've never been to a Brazilian style steakhouse before, so this was definitely a unique experience. I was celebrating a friends Birthday, it was a Sunday evening and pretty packed. We had a reservation, so we had no wait to be seated. As soon as we were seated we headed straight to the salad bar and grabbed some veggies (which ended up being more than needed) as soon as we sat back at the table we were greeted with the meat. Amazing!! Everything was so good, you want to try as many as possible and we soon learned that all the veggies we piled on our plate had no chance. Protein for days!!! The rolls were soooo good. They also brought fresh plantains, fried Yucatan, and mashed potatoes to the table. Overall it was a great experience! Definitely recommend it!",5.0,"Dec 30, 2015"

"Came here for a friends 40th birthday in a large party.  The good: Overall ambience was good. Most of the meats were delicious esp the house specialty steak. A friend who was in the know asked for the short ribs and that was delicious. The sides on the table were all delicious. You will definitely be full with a reasonable variety of meats. Desserts were delicious (I had the tres leches, but others had the cheesecake, chocolate lava, and all enjoyed them). The ""so-so"": service was quite variable. Some were great but some were not so. I found myself being skipped randomly for offerings of meat.  When we asked for the short ribs they came out with it but left after serving only 2 of the twelve on the table (we had to call them back).  One of the servers was rather brusque when we were calling their attention to this.  On the other hand other servers were lovely.  The salad bar was ok, kind of random. Reasonable quality but no where near the steak/meats. Don't waste space in your stomach with the sausage or bacon wrapped steak which was over cooked and dry.  I have to say for the price I would have expected more.",3.0,"May 8, 2016"
"Thank you NYC Restaurant Week! What a treat! Factor to point out to other restaurant week customers: you only get 11 out of their 16 varieties of meats offered at full price. Understandable, although I was looking forward to some rabbit and beef ribs which was not included in the deal. Enjoyed the steak fest all the same. Did not touch a single sausage offered in order to save tummy space for my favorite house steak, garlic beef sirloin and cheese encrusted pork. I recommend you do the same in terms of gorging strategy. The sausages aren't gonna change your life, so let them pass by.High ceilings and accessible location definitely beats Fogo de Chao's San Antonio and Vegas locations, although I strangely remember Vegas location's salad bar spread to be more impressive. Its a can't-go-wrong option if you enjoy an interactive and hearty dining experience.",4.0,"Aug 7, 2014"

"A bit pricey for all-you-can-eat dinner, but at least they give you your money's worth by giving you a salad bar with more greens, fix-ins and even things like fresh salmon that you can ever want. Service is always fast, and waiters are always very attentive. The pão de queijo appetizer was very well made and best version of the Brazilian bread I've had so far. Overall, the food was amazing although some cuts of the all-you-can-eat meat were too greasy depending on what you ordered and there were some misses like the Parmesan-encrusted pork (unappetizing as it sounds). Still, I was very pleased and at least I got a lot of value for the high price.",4.0,"Dec 10, 2015"
"300th review!! Woo! Only took a few years haha. I'm glad my 300th one will be used to review the place my boyfriend took me to on my birthday. So my boyfriend has been talking about this place ever so often ever since we started dating, so since March, I've heard about this place a good 20 or so times. He wouldn't tell me where we were going, but I had a feeling it was Fogo since we were also celebrating our anniversary. This place is really well decorated and I felt like the wait-staff makes you feel like you are right at home. Everyone was so friendly! The salad bar kinda kicked my ass, I knew I was playing into Fogo's game. I packed my plate on and stuffed my face haha. A huge rookie mistake that I don't understand why I made it. I guess I just really wanted to try everything. I'm not a huge steak person but I was really excited about the experience! Though I didn't get to try everything because I got full very quickly, I really loved the steak that was wrapped in bacon, sooooo good!! Then at the end of it, they allowed me to pick a dessert and I picked the Tres Leches. They took my choice of dessert, wrote ""Happy Birthday Stella"" on the place, and put a candle on the cake. Such an amazing experience. The place is pretty pricey but the experience and food were really worth it all. Can't wait to go back!",5.0,"Dec 8, 2017"

"While I like Fogo de Chao in general, I think my enthusiasm over the whole Brazilian steakhouse premise is starting to wane.  This is my third time to a Fogo (twice in Philly, once in NYC) and I find myself less and less excited.Fogo-NYC is a great looking venue and the service is quick and efficient, though that's not a particularly hard thing to accomplish at a buffet-style restaurant.  The dining experience itself is unique, making it worth at least one trip.  It is also worth the trip if you enjoy eating embarrassingly large quantities of meat, as I do.The issue is that though the meat is generally good and varied, the whole meal is rather one-dimensional and will be the exact same every time you go.  Makes repeat visits unappealing.  Also, in this particular trip the meat was salted almost to the point of being inedible (and this coming from a guy that envies those deer and their salt licks).  I can also attest to the neck-craning frustration that can result from seeking out one particular cut, though the servers are usually good about taking requests.That said, any meat lover owes it to themselves to try out a place like this, and Fogo does it better than most.",4.0,"Apr 16, 2014"

The reason i go to a place like this is to get the Brazilian atmosphere/experience. The atmosphere should be feel like i'm at a Brazilian restaurant. The other reason i like going to a Brazilian steak house is for the meat variety and quality. One of my favorite things to eat here are the lamb chops.

"Our experience at this Fogo de Chao was great! Our server Julian was very accomodating of us. We kept changing our minds about desert options, drinks and sides but he was very patient and made sure everything was just right. When we asked one of the guys serving meat (not Julian) if they could make us some with less salt he rolled his eyes a bit and said he could only do no salt. When Lorena stopped by to check on us I told her the guy said they couldn't make the steak how my friend had asked, she said she will make sure everything was exactly how we needed it with just less salt and not no salt and it came out exactly right! I knew we were super high maintenance and would have hated myself if I were my server but Lorena was very accomodating and made us feel like we weren't being a burden at all. My friend from Korea who was with me said it was the best service he's had in America so far.

Totally worth 50 bucks.",5.0,"Aug 10, 2018"

"Amazing rodizio place for Brazilian and meat madness food. The cuts are just mouth watering with their traditional ""on the stick"" meats that they cut right in your table. The variety is just overwhelming. Be sure to eat what you like the most and leave space for other options because you'll get full so quickly. Especially with their all you can eat salad bar that has soooo many delicious things like the smoked salmon, manchego cheese, prosciutto, salads in any color and veggies that can be a nice side for the meats. But again, don't over eat because the salad bar can fool you and by the time the meat comes to your table you are already ready to go to sleep. Go for the classics: picanha (i n c r e d i b l e), alcatra and specially the flank steak that melts in your mouth. The bottom sirloin was good too. The other cuts were ok but nothing to die for and especially not to get full with them. The warm pao de queijo in your table makes the difference. You arrive and seat and that cheese bread takes you straight to Copacabana.The sides are ok, fried polenta, mashed potatoes and plantains. The last one was a really good dessert for my palate.It's not a 5 star restaurant because I think the salad bar could be way better or at least have other Brazilian dishes and more variety. The salads were on the flavorless side, lack of dressing. And also not all the meats are great. Stick with what you like and don't be afraid to try other things and leave in the plate whatever you feel that it doesn't make the difference. Also, ask the waiters for the meats you like. We were waiting specially for the picanha that never arrived till we told the waiter. The selection of desserts is not that wide but still a pretty decent cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake. The ambiance is super nice and classy. Good for the value! $38 all you can eat and prime meats. Was restaurant week though but anyway the regular price is not that far from that.",4.0,"Aug 17, 2015"

Salad bar and pao de queijo are always outstanding. Meat selections are pretty good but I usually have to wait to get a nice medium well selections. I've never had the pork or chicken here only the beef. The garlic steak is pretty much life. Make sure you graze at the salad bar until your meat comes otherwise you will fill up quickly and this will likely be the most expensive salad bar meal of your life. Do not come if you are vegetarian or don't eat beef. It will be a waste of money. Get a caipirinha over a mojito. The special drinks, especially the one in the pineapple, is delicious!

I went to the Fogo de Chao in Rio De Janeiro a couple of years ago and had a great experience & wanted to try the one in NYC. And today was the day! I had to admit that I made the mistake of high expectation. The decoration is good. But the place is way too packed! Maybe they have to crank up the column due to restaurant week but most tables are less than 3 feet apart from each other. Let's focus on the food. Most of the meat are way too salty with a lot of seasoning.Wonder if it's a trick to get you to drink more water & eat less or due to lack of freshness... The variety seems to be really lacking. You keep seeing 5 of the meat going around but not the rest. I've been expecting the Cordeiro all night and only got it toward the end after asking different waiters 3 times. And by then I was too full to really taste it! I know first world problem but still! Also I really like the chicle leg but it only came around once! The salad bar is alright although I remember the one in Brazil had seafood. But can't really blame them since the cost is a lot higher in nyc.I doubt I will go back.,3.0,"Mar 5, 2015"

"I went with a couple of coworkers for Restaurant Week Lunch.  This is a great choice for $25.  Lunch or dinner you get the same food so why not pay less at lunch time?  If you don't choose the restaurant week option, there is also a $38 lunch option which includes filet mignon, rib-eye and lamb chops.  We stuck to the restaurant week menu because there is more than enough meat to satisfy us.When we walked in, we thought the bar area was beautiful.  Then we walked down the stairs and it was just as beautiful in the dining area.  We felt that the staff was very attentive from the moment we walked in.  The salad bar was very impressive.  Such a wide variety of food.  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  In addition to some smoked/cured meats, there was also smoked salmon.Now we are ready for some meat! I love how they had three chunks of meat on one skewer.  They were each cooked to different temperatures...well, medium, medium rare.  Just so happens that our table all had different tastes and this was great.  Our favorites were the chicken drumstick and garlic steak.  One coworker really enjoyed the sausage and the other coworker really enjoyed the lamb.  The only thing that we all didn't enjoy was the chicken wrapped in bacon.  This was breast meat which was a little try.  I think they used Canadian bacon or something of that nature.  Maybe after eating a juicy drumstick, the breast meat just didn't impress.  The meal also came with mashed potatoes, fried polenta and sweet plantains.  I wasn't a big fan of the polenta but the other two sides were good.  At some point a manager came over to see if there was anything in particular that we are still waiting to try and we hadn't gotten the lamb yet.  She had someone come right over with it.  That was very nice.  Of course it wouldn't be restaurant week without dessert.  You had a choice of NY style cheesecake, Key lime pie and chocolate mousse cake.  I had the key lime pie.  It was a little too sweet but I ate it anyway!  They give a sliver and it was not presented nicely at all.  Just a thin slice laying on a plate.

We had plates to be cleared for new ones but he never bothered with it even though he was walking by with nothing in his hands several times. Another waiter walked by and right away he cleaned our table up and provided us with new plates and a smile.  D.P. never asked to see if we were doing ok from beginning to end. The only time he was friendly to us was when we were leaving. We didn't spend $80/person plus tips to not feel taken care off. What a shame when everyone else in the establishment especially the manager showed great hospitality!",3.0,"Aug 25, 2015"
"Great concept. Great ambiance. Great for a first date or group dinner. Place is loud, lots of traffic with servers constantly walking to tables and people going to the salad bar. Large selection of meats that come around to your table with servers who cut it onto your plate. Meat is mostly seasoned the same and some can be over cooked or under-seasoned depending on the cut you get. The salad bar is extensive with different cheeses, salads, deli meats, vegetables, fruit, etc. Stay away from the overpriced house drinks they offer! Large wine selection to choose from. Would definitely go back, been here twice on two different trips to NYC. bring your wallet!",4.0,"Oct 3, 2015"

Me and my family really enjoyed all of the selections of foods from the salad bar. And the selections of meats were delicious. I like the idea of the flip card.

I've been here two times now. I only come during restaurant week because that is when it is affordable and you get all the perks of regular dinning. For $38 you get the full salad bar which has rice beans and tons of different vegetables and salad. Then we get all the meats and poultry that come around which are prepared wonderfully! I normally like medium well but some meats I would definitely ask for a by under. The service is amazing they are very attentive and quick! Everything is really delicious. During the restaurant week special its $38 per person and you get the full salad bar all the meats for as long as you want and desert. With tax and one drink it comes out to a little over $50 a person which is about half the price if you come on a regular day. This place is a must but you hero come when your really hungry! If your not that hungry it might not be worth it.,5.0,"Jul 25, 2015"

"PURE GLUTTONOUS SIN!!!I went to Fogo de Chao with my fam for my graduation. I figured I'd choose a bougie restaurant since I knew I wasn't going to be paying. The restaurant was absolutely GORGEOUS! But I expected that. It was very elegant. We started off with a bottle of $60 red semi-sweet cabernet (which was delicious). From there we hit the mega salad bar in the middle of the room. I heard rumors about how amazing this salad bar is and how you should only have a small sampling or you'd ruin your appetite. I picked at the variety of cheeses, veggies and cold cut selections. When I was finished picking, I turned over that coaster to the green side and was welcomed with 16 cuts of heaven!!! (Of course not all at the same time). Everything was sooooooooo good, EXCEPT for the parmesan pork chop -- that was NOT the business. I felt overwhelmed at moments with all of the selections of meat being thrown at me, but all I had to do was turn my coaster over and partake in some regrouping.

"For Brazilian Rodizio (all you can eat grilled meats) this is certainly the best choice in NYC.  Although, for dinner at $59.50 per person, it is probably too pricey for what it is.  The highlights for meat were the garlic sirloin, house special top sirloin, and the leg of lamb which was really the best I've had at these type of restaurants.  They servers are attentive to make sure you can select your preferred doneness of each slice selected.  I really appreciated the polished and friendly service here from the managers to the servers.  Really much better in this regard than other similar restaurants in NYC.  I thought the salad bar had outstanding fresh offerings as well.    We did have a very nice experience here overall, and I found out the lunch offerings are exactly the same as the dinner with all of the meat selections offered, but it is discounted to $39.50.",5.0,"Jun 26, 2014"

"Went to Fogo NYC last night. It started that they did not have our reservation despite of placing a phone call for it, but somehow they found a table for us. We ordered the caipirinhas that took forever, then I offered to prepare myself ( just bring the cachaça, lime and sugar and I do it.) then we were told there were two big parties and only one bar tender. Went to the salad bar and I felt it has been downgraded compared to the past. Meats were not cut right, the picanha was too thick, making one side medium and completely raw on the other side. We were tired to see chicken legs and sausage over and over again and we lost how many times we asked for picanha and fraldinha. I then asked the short ribs I always have and it was when we were about to choose the dessert when I asked again what happened with the ""costela assada"" and when they finally brought it, the table was cleaned already but still, we had a little piece of it, gave up the dessert and ask for the bill. What is happening with Fogo de Chão?I've been going to Fogo since decades...  (Maitre Luiz-Luiz Carlos-Odair Jose-Zequinha-Robledo who then I saw in Washington and left to open his own churrascaria) in São Paulo where I used to live then in many places I travelled for business ...

It was a horrible experience, and the only food that I tried was the rice and beans at it was awful. I'm never going there again.

"We went there recently for restaurant week and it seems they have made a lot of improvements compared to our previous visits.

Other than that, everything was good.",4.0,"Aug 1, 2017"
"We're so disappointed with the service. The hostesses are rude! Both in person and over the phone! Really bad phone manners!!! Some of the hostesses assumed that we didn't know portuguese and was even more rude. But the servers (waiters and waitresses and even the ""meat"" servers) are very friendly.  They didn't serve the meat often and even when we asked to bring the meat over and over. They kept bringing the ones that we clearly said politely several times we don't eat that. And the other meat they served almost 1 hour after when we already lost the appetite and were ready to ask for the check. In general, they seemed to be very stingy in serving the meat. I went there for different occasions, different times - lunch and dinner, different days of the week, with different people, restaurant week, etc, but in the past 2 1/2 years that's how they've been serving the meat. And the quality is going down.One time, when they brought us a meat and because it was the last piece and almost burned, we asked for a new one. What that guy did was put that piece with the new and served us that piece that we told him that we didn't want. SERIOUSLY? Did he think we're that stupid? After that and how they serve the meat (rodízio), we decided not to go back there neither recommend the place.  We do NOT recommend this place.

We held my company holiday party there since we figured rodizio would be a fun choice. The salad bar was fairly extensive and included cured meats and cheeses. The meats were tender and well flavored. I liked the fact that you could choose from the skewer how they were cooked. Leave room for desert since they are fresh and not overly sweet. The key lime pie is one one best I have ever tried.,4.0,"Jan 1, 2016"
"Came for Restaurant Week! I called in 15 minutes before arrival, and even though I didn't have a reservation, they had a table waiting for my group of 7 once we arrived. All the meat was great! I love how you can specify how you like your meat (I like mine rare), and the server will just cut from a different part of the meat. Don't be afraid to ask for a bigger or smaller portion; they'll happily oblige. The appetizers were good too, especially the polenta fries and the bread. The salad bar didn't have as much variety as the one in Vegas, but it was still a nice respite from all that meat. As part of RW, we each got to choose a dessert (chocolate cake, key lime pie, or cheesecake). I tried the key lime pie, while everyone else got the chocolate cake. The key lime pie was good, but the taste of the chocolate cake I got was awesome. The only negative thing is that there would be periods when none of us had anything on our plates, but no meat was coming out. I actually kinda liked it, since it helped me pace myself, but if you're coming here to get super stuffed then it might take longer than usual haha. Other than that, service and ambiance were awesome. Would definitely come again!",5.0,"Aug 12, 2014"
"I don't have anything to complain about this restaurant. The food is astounding; from the wide variety of  on the salad bar, the cuts of meats, all the way to the desserts. From beginning to end it is obvious that there is a lot to choose from and you don't feel pressured at all. The salad bar is always clean and crisp, clearly being taken care of and attended for at all times. The wait staff is surprisingly good at communicating with one another. Anyone that passes by always pays attention to body movements, whether you need a clean plate or you have a question. There was never a time where I needed to ask for a refill on my drink, because the staff seemed to notice it before I did. The amount of meat that is available to me is astounding. It ranges from beef, to pork, to chicken, and surprisingly enough lamb. All the meats are juicy, and the wait staff communication is impressive. The meat servers remember your meat preference and you only have to say it one time. My favorite part of dinner is the end, where the dessert tray comes around and there's a visual on what I would like to get after being stuffed with pounds of protein. The server who presents the desserts is extremely friendly, excited, and is very thorough in explaining the desserts presented and flavors you can choose from. For the price you pay, you get unlimited salad, unlimited meat, and it couldn't be a better bargain. From food to service you won't be disappointed.",5.0,"Sep 23, 2014"

Had a great time and great first experience coming to fogo de chao last night!!! Came because a close friend raved about the restaurant so I figured with restaurant week approaching I should take advantage of the discounted price n I'm glad I did. For starters me n my party arrived 30 mins late for our 10pm reservations but the still accommodated us n ensure we would stu get the full experience even though kitchen closed at 11. Boy did they ever treat us like we came at 7 pm. From the salad bar to the sides and cheesy bread the waiters and even manager made sure we had food made sure we got extra sides n even let us know when they were gonna shut down the salad bar so we could get more be4 they did!!! Also my friend didn't eat beef do they made sure they brought her chicken breast and chicken legs. The staff just made the whole experience great taking one star off because the messed up on our credit cards kept charging one card twice for two different payments it just became annoying but didn't damper the night!!!!!!

"This was my first Brazilian steakhouse experience.  I decided to take my carnivorous Valentine to Fogo de Chao for Valentines day and in hindsight, it was a genius decision.  We starved ourselves all day in preparation for this meal. Those more experienced had warned us not to fall to the temptation of that salad bar.  But alas, the fresh kale salad, arugula, crispy bacon strips, lox, romaine, olives, peppers were too difficult to resist.  Then came the cheesy breads.  Boy were those hard to pass up, so we didn't and we ate them and they were freaking delicious.  Simultaneously a parade of succulent, juicy hot off the fire meats started.  Filet mignon coming from the right, lamb chops coming from behind, pork sausages and chicken coming full speed ahead.   We had to flip the card over to red for a bit of a reprieve.  Deep breath, sit up straight in the chair, another deep breath and we flipped back the card to green.  Here comes the rum steak, ribs, garlic steak, top sirloin oh and I need some more filet mignon.  My stomach hurts, can't stop now, but I must. Card on red, yet here comes more plantains and cheese bread.  I didn't ask for that, but okay; I'll take it.  Feeling like a complete glutton.  So glad I have my Valentine and he loves me, because I'm so FAT at this point.  I wonder if he will love me this much when I'm this fat?  He claims he will, but I digress.....oh shit here comes some more of that top sirloin must flip back to green!Finally, by the end the meal both of us couldn't lift a finger and were physically unable to flip over the red card.  So they brought us the check.  $60 a piece, which is not that bad considering the carnage.  A completely unexpected surprise is that they gave us a gift card for a free dinner or lunch on them during our next visit as a Valentines Day gift.  Wow! I think they've just created an annual tradition for us.Ambiance and service was great.  This is an absolutely beautiful restaurant inside.  The food overall I would probably give 4 stars.  The side dishes were decent but nothing spectacular however the whole experience merits 5 stars!",5.0,"Feb 16, 2014"

Polenta was old and tasteless. Pao de queijo was more like a biscoito globo: not a Pao de queijo at all I always sad that there was no restaurant service in this entire country like the one  FDC provided. I guess not in NYC. They waitress took our order and never came back to our table. We didn't get the wine, nor the polenta, bananas, water, etc. at one point I raised my hand to call one of the passers attention, and a manager came over, to whom we asked for what we wanted. At that point we gave up on the wine. At the very end the waitress came, trying to start a conversation, probably to get a good tip.

We paid the restaurant a visit yesterday and found the food to be extremely disappointing. I made a point to try every type of meat offered, but most of the beef had a liver-like taste/powdery texture and the lambs were VERY gamey. Additionally, most of the meats were dry and even the juicy cuts were tough. The worst was the bacon wrapped filet mignon, which had a chemical taste to it.The only meats I found edible were the port ribs, sausages and the beer-marinated chicken wings. I felt sick after the meal and continued to feel sick this morning.The cheesy Brazilian bread was spectacular and was by far the best part of the meal. However, I would not pay $90 ($60 + a soda + tax and tip) just for the bread.The staff was friendly, but almost too friendly that it seemed forced and, frankly, a bit creepy.

How do you work in a steakhouse not knowing the basic steak sauce. Besides that we had our card flip on green and we even try waving the meat carvers down but they were busy just taking care of the bigger tables and just kept walking past us. We left because it was to much of a hassle to have dinner here and was tired of waving the meat carvers down and paid $340 for 4 people but ended up getting halal guys on the way home. Oh and they do not being you a dessert menu because there desserts cost $11.50 a plate so they bring over a plate of dessert for you to choose from.

"OK, I admit: I only come during RW. Every RW for the past two years, I've come at least once or twice. Maybe around 6 visits in total? But the RW selection is so similar to the full menu that it's hard to justify paying full tilt (especially in NY where Fogo de Chao is more expensive than other cities like Boston, where I've gladly paid full price).You know what you're getting, and it's almost always solid. The salty meats are impossible to not love, and are incredibly addicting. I could eat the top sirloin all night long and nothing else! And I think I've mastered the strategy by getting as little as possible at the salad bar, skipping the addicting cheese bread and the starches, and just sticking to meat! (They try to fill you up on carbs, but I resist the urge!!). Seriously, it's great and if you're a meat eater, you should go. Oh, and the flank steak on this past visit was, like, 50000x better than I remember it being! It was my favorite meat!!Only reason not for 5 stars was because of the beyond foul hostess staff I encountered a couple visits ago. They were so rude and unprofessional on a variety of levels (including behavior that would be unequivocally dismissal-worthy if any manager saw it in real-time) that I needed to address it with the GM. He was admittedly very apologetic and tried to make things right that night by offering the full selection of meats even though we were on RW pricing.Love this place though. Go there for the food, and it won't disappoint.",4.0,"Aug 14, 2016"

My opinion is probably biased as I'm a huge Fogo de Chao fan but boy is the food good here. I'm a big eater and fine dining or casual fine dining simply doesn't work for me.

"One of the best Brazilian steakhouses I've been to. I've been to over 10 around the us and I can honestly say all components that lead to a great restaurant are present here. The buffet setup has fresh salads, meats, cheeses, rice, beans, scalloped potatoes and all but what brings everyone here? The Rodizio. ALL YOU CAN EAT MEAT!  The highlights? Skirt steak. Top steak. Garlic steak, the fogo de chao special cut and the chicken wrapped in bacon. Yes almost all Rodizios have these dishes but this place has an amazing ability to prepare the food correctly. Additionally, the service was nothing less than excellent. Very attentive staff that was very accommodating and always on top of our wants and needs.",5.0,"Jun 29, 2014"

Loved the upscale ambiance and  sophisticated decor of this place especially the stairs leading to the actual restaurant. Even the paper towel in the bathroom was classy that I had to take about 2 home with me! I came here for RW dinner. The service was fast and great.  The salad bar was pretty solid and the different types of meat were also great. I just wish I remember the ones I loved the most. There were about 2 that really stood out and I thought were cooked to perfection with their juiciness and taste. The desserts were meh. This is the type of place you have to take advantage of during RW because you really get your money's worth!,4.0,"Aug 10, 2014"
"Cheese bread and lamb chops is all I gotta say. Pretty pricey for what you pay for... $65 a person for dinner. For someone who can't eat too much meat, didn't think it was quite worth it however the cheese bread and lamb chops were the highlight of my night. The filet wrapped in bacon, and ribs weren't so bad either. They do have a salad bar, drinks go for around $15 each.",3.0,"Apr 15, 2014"

Endless amounts of meats and chicken prepared differently and seasoned perfectly. It was great. Service very attentive to every detail. I watched the team the way they worked, the guy commanding his staff on top of every little detail. 5 stars should be the baseline for this place. Can't wait to go here again",5.0,"Mar 16, 2014"
"I never do these but had to make an account and thank the manager, Ricardo for his wonderful customer service. My boyfriend and I visited NY for the first time and were highly recommended this place for dinner so we decided to go. Upon arrival the hostess asked if we had reservations and we didn't and said they were completely booked for the night and weren't taking walk ins. This confused us since we saw many empty tables. So, instead my boyfriend found the manager and explained to him the situation, in a super nice fashion, we were not upset, irate, or mad, just confused. The manager thanked us for stopping by and going directly to him and said he'd have a table for us in the next 5 minutes, and like clockwork, he did. We were in no way upset with the hostess, she was simply doing her job and gave us information that was given to her, and she sat us and was very sweet about it. We thanked the manager after dinner and he was very kind, helpful, and hospitable. He made our night with saying ""don't worry, I'll take care of you and your girlfriend"" and he did. The food was delicious as well! definitely recommend any carnivore to over indulge here.Thanks again for the great service Ricardo",5.0,"Oct 3, 2017"

"Brazilian Steakhouse...need I say more? Well, the answer is YES! First off, some people tend to associate an 'all you can eat' joint with mediocre food quality and service. But this place can change those misconstrued perceptions.Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and not only was it a treat for her, but for us also!Decor: Spacious modern design with a Gigantic ~30 foot engraved portrait of a gaucho (Brazilian Cowboy) hung on the wall. Three floors setup with downstairs as the main dining room, and bar on the main and upper level. Service: Greeted by two lovely ladies with a bright welcoming smile. Knowledgeable bartender (that's where I got the word gaucho from) entertained me with the history of the restaurant (not included in this review, visit them and speak with Alex). Wait staff were also consistently attentive, polite, and on point. Food: Plentiful choices at their fresh salad bar. I got prosciutto,  asparagus, crispy crunchy bacon, salami, and kale. (Try not to fill yourself up too much with all the options at the salad bar, as i strongly recommend the 2 minute wait for the meat to start coming is definitely worth your patience.) Quality of the meat was spectacular and shockingly surprising as each cut  were delivered at a reasonably accurate degree of how [well, medium, rare, & your in betweens] you preferred it to be cooked when given the option (e.g., couldn't choose for the Frango- bacon wrapped chicken) while keeping in mind that its an 'all you can eat' setup and that the food is constantly being pumped out and served. The Filet Mignon, Alcatra (top sirloin), Beef Ancho (rib eye) to name a few, were all well seasoned lightly and the true flavor, level of tenderness and juciness of each cut really stood out. And yes, some pieces just melted in your mouth.Barely left any room for desert. (Forgot to pace myself as every bite was just one yum after another.) Luckily I don't mind sharing and ended up splitting a Tres Leches cake.. yeah that was good too!Overall, great job to the restaurant and their entire staff. Deducted a star as we were not offered their recommended (by other yelpers) cheese bread. Maybe I'm just being too harsh...But I'll definitely be back.",4.0,"Feb 24, 2014"

"Came here during the week for lunch with couple colleagues, we asked about the Gaucho Lunch, which was advertised on the website. The server first pretended he has no idea what we were talking about. Then trying to push us to go for the Full Churrasco Experience by overstating the price of the Gaucho and understanding the price of the Churrasco), even though we politely told him we would rather do the Gaucho Lunch. After failing to sell us the full Churrasco experience he was no where to be found the rest of the time we were there.",2.0,"Jul 12, 2016"
"I had referred a friend for a job and they had actually made him an offer and he had accepted so we came here for dinner to celebrate.This place is really family and kid-friendly.  No one would look out of place here.  It has a nice Vegas buffet feel (like Bellagio level) but even more upscale.  Dress ranges from casual to business professional and less of the going out party look.  The interior decor is trendy-looking and beautiful, but without the loud music or the obnoxious crowd.  I love the way they have their wine display set-up.  It is artistic and functional at the same time.  The space is just artsy, whimsy and spacious.I'd never been to a Brazilian BBQ place before, but now that I have gone, I would definitely recommend to people when they have out-of-town guests and are looking for somewhere unique to take them.  There is an unlimited buffet salad bar and they bring you cheese potatoes, bread and banana plantains for your table, but the key is this little disk that everyone gets.  If you flip it green (""go""), waiters pop up out of nowhere and keep offering you meat non-stop.  They ask how you want your meat and some sides of the meat from which they cut are medium rare, some are medium, some are medium well, etc . . . And they keep bringing you meat until you flip the disk red (""stop"").  You keep flipping back and forth until you really are done.  It is just fun all-around.  I think we ended up trying everything and it was all good.  Some  cuts I found a bit salty, but I kinda do everywhere.  None of the meats were too exotic and I was able to eat everything.I had enough to feel sated, but not full.  I think most people would eat till they are bloated in this kind of situation, but I was really there more for the experience.  After all the meat, they bring around a hard liquor cart which looked like a candy cart really just with alcohol.  And then they bring around the dessert menu (which is not included in the price of the all you can eat meat fest) but you end up kinda wanting to end your meal with something sweet.  I would recommend trying one of the exotic Brazilian desserts.  Mainly because you can have the standard creme brulee, molten chocolate cake or cheesecake anywhere.  We ended up settling on the pineapple caramel ice cream dessert which was warm, different and delicious.This was hands down one of the funnest dinners I have had in New York.  I'd gone in kinda expecting pig over a spitfire smelly meat fest with men beating their chests (j/k), but it was actually quite a genteel and civilized dinner experience.  It was almost surprisingly like fine dining.  Service was attentive and the waiters always helpful and polite even if we did have to get up to go get our own salads.  ;P",5.0,"May 23, 2014"
"Yes, I am a fan of the restaurant but soon realized I'm not a fan of the concept.  When I was younger, I lived on places like these when my carnivorous intuition was at it's peak.  But now, I can no longer handle all these meats especially at the pace they come.  I was literally full after 15 mins and these guys never stop coming once you have your yes card flipped over.  I get a big annoyed w. that kind of service as it seems rushed as I have 3 different kinds of meat already on my plate.  Good selection of quality meats but everything was underseasoned so I was disappointed.",4.0,"Sep 20, 2014"

"Some friends and I dined here tonight. The service was excellent and on point, The drinks from the bar were delicious, and the meat, savory goodness! Some of them just melted in your mouth! The only downside was that a few of them were really salty. The bacon wrapped filet was really salty, not too impressed. The salad bar was good, but you would think for $60/person, they would have more options at the salad bar, but in all honesty, you don't come to these places to eat salad, its all about the MEAT! In general, very tasty, and for my 1st time trying lamb chops, I'm a fan! We had the key lime pie, creme brule, and turtle cheesecake for dessert. Creme brule was fabulous, cheesecake was good, a bit too sweet for me though, and the key lime pie was good, Also had some cappuccinos, those we also good, but tiny. Overall, our dining experience was great, definitely left full! Decor is nice and modern, and the staff is really friendly!

"It was meat madness. For a fun night with old friends who won't judge, Frogo is the spot. This is a no-holds-barred Brazilian rodizio, all you can shovel into your mouth grilled meat joint. Red = stop. Green = go. We were seated and told that as soon as we flipped our placards from red to green, the meat would flow and it did! Flip back and forth from red to green when you need a moment to catch your breath and socialize with your friends at the table. Filets, ribs, sirloin, bacon wrapped awesomeness, lamb, chicken, all manners of proteins. There also a salad bar for vegetarians, but really, why distract yourself? It's a great spot if you have a big crowd and you're ok with not spending the night in a queue full of hipsters. We were totally down.

Ugh.Solid churrascaria. Nice atmosphere, pleasant enough service, and delicious MEAT!I used to go to Master Grill, and Green Fields out in Queens back in the day, and this place is nicer than both, imo.I like it better for lunch, as I can't eat $62 worth of meat.

I really enjoyed the meats and the salad bars. They were very attentive with what cuts of meat they have and how they tasted. With the beef, you get to tell them if you would like a medium rare piece ( which I prefer) or a medium well/ well done piece(which most of my family preferred). The salad bar had a great selection. They also have rice behind the salad bar if you want to have that with your meal. The restaurant week menu also comes with dessert. They were not that great but it's nice that it came with it.

"I love everything about this place! (Restaurant Week lunch)The dining area is beautiful. In addition, the food was the best I've ever tasted. The thing about restaurant week is that most restaurants give you a small portion. However, at Fogo, you get unlimited appetizer, access to the exotic salad bar and all-you-can-eat meat. The waiters and waitresses kept feeding us. They kept bringing us more and more food until we had to stop them at some point because we were struggling to finish everything. The meat was well roasted but we got to try all the cuts available to us during restaurant week. The MOST AMAZING dish was the cheese bread though. I've never tasted anything like that before! If you really want to get your money's worth, this is definitely the place to be. Also, Roger, our waiter, took such good care of us. He provided the best service I've ever had in any other restaurant! I would definitely come back again!",5.0,"Aug 8, 2015"
"Doesn't do justice to it's brand. The New York location is mediocre at best. I'm Brazilian and consider Fogo de Chão the best churrascaria in Brasil, however, this one is quite insulting. The meat is not the best and also not cut well. The sides are dry and not plentiful. The salad bar is sad. The kicker is that service is obviously slow so you don't get to consume much meat. We had the green go card up and had to call the waiter for meat. Tried it a couple of times and will definitely not waste my money here again. Sadly I don't recommend.",2.0,"Dec 21, 2014"
"Went here on a Wednesday night, the place wasn't packed and it wasn't empty either. Me and my boyfriend started off with some drinks and then we headed to the salad bar, there were different types of salad, fruits, cheese, and one of our favorite things at the salad bar was the bacon, it had some spice to it but was also sweet. Now for the meat, the best meat I had was the beef wrapped in bacon. Everything else they had was good too but there was one that I didn't like at all, it honestly was just bland and I couldn't chew it enough to digest it. We were given mash potatoes and sweet plantains and that was nice too. For the price it's a really good deal, yeah it could be out of your price range, but for one night out on the town with your significant other or a friend then it's worth it.

The meat is to die for. But the server came once and we never saw him again. To the point that my boyfriend never ordered a second drink. We thought they ignored us because we look young. We were dressed nicely, for a birthday dinner and very patient & courteous,  but we were ignored. They also ignored the young couple next to us but served the older gentlemen in the area much more attentively. There were barely any tables but we still barely had any service. We asked for a dessert menu and waited so long that we decided to just ask for the check, which my boyfriend had to get up to go ask for. We'd also reserved the table because it was my birthday and they put us downstairs in the back, and didn't acknowledge the birthday at all. We still left 20%.

"My husband and I love Fogo. We have been to the Washington DC and Beverly Hills locations multiple times. The food in the Midtown location was just as excellent as it normally is but the services wasn't what we've come to expect and love. We were here twice, once in September and once in December and had the misfortune of having the same server twice. The cheese bread is my absolute favorite but we had been seated for about thirty minutes and it hadn't come to the table yet. When I asked our server about it she casually said ""it's coming"" and then walked away. We finally got it, and since there are only four small rolls, it was gone in an instant. I had to hound my waiter again for it and also tried asking bus boys passing by to get another basket. The same was true for all the sides. It seemed like we had mounds to steak piling up on our plates but the sides were so scarce and I like to enjoy everything together. I'd rather not spend my dinner asking people repeatedly for the same thing, and for a restaurant with prices like the top tier steakhouses, we expect service to match and unfortunately, at this location it hasn't.As a side note: the gauchos are great and they always have wonderful service.

"Brazilian churrascaria means meat meat and more meat. Beef, lamb, chicken, pork - you name it. Served on great big skewers and cut based on your temperature preference.

Now we had to ask multiple times for our water glasses to be refilled. We were never given clean plates so I ate my meat on my salad plate and I did not fill the meats were in rotation like i'm use to. there was only one server that actually asked how I liked my meat done. Everything was either under cooked or over cooked usually i'm eating until I can't eat anymore but this night i actually walked out ready to go somewhere else and eat. When I finally could flag down the waiter for our section I told him what kind of dessert I wanted and he walks away gets me a dessert menu and tells me to pick one, walks away again and comes back to take my order like I already didn't tell him what I wanted......all in all I will be back for the fogo experience just not to this location.",2.0,"Jan 30, 2017"
"Again, probably a narrow miss for four stars. I've been to Fogo in other cities - NY is not as good, but still not bad. Positives - the meat is very good. The salad bar is good, albeit significantly less extensive than i remember in other locations. The room is very impressive, as if they had handed a talented interior designer a blank check. When we walked in, one of our party commented ""this place won't last long - they can't possibly charge enough to pay the rent on this space."" And the meat is very good.The negatives - the service was borderline overdone - attentive is good, intrusive is bad after a certain point it becomes annoying and distracting - I continually felt like i was being up-sold - i had four different guys offer to help me with the wine list within a 3 minute period, and suggest i consider the jereboams as good value for such a large group, which if my intentions ran to Silver Oak, I suppose it might have been.  Long tables jammed tightly together are sub-optimal for a group of twelve - conversation would have been easier at round tables. And then there are the desserts. This is the first time i have ever ordered dessert at a Fogo de Chao (it's not clear to me why anyone would order dessert after consuming 2/3 of a cow for dinner, but for some reason it seemed like a good idea.) I can't say that all the desserts were bad, but the consistency of the flan could only have been achieved by adding liberal amounts of portland cement to the recipe. I would say it was purchased at a supermarket, but i have never found that bad a flan at a supermarket. The key lime pie was ok, if unexceptional, but the flan was certainly exceptional.So, the ultimate fogo experience still involves a flight to another city, but if that doesn't fit in your schedule, this location isn't bad...and the meat is very good.",3.0,"Feb 1, 2014"
"My family and I had the full lunch which included all meats,chicken,lamb,and pork,and the salad bar. All meats were well seasoned and very delicious. Salad bar offered fruits,salads,vegetables, cheese,rice,breads,etc. All food items were EXCELLENT. Servers were helpful in explaining what each meat were. This was the best dinning experience we had experience in a very long time. It's a very warm and welcoming environment. Looking forward to our next visit.",5.0,"Apr 21, 2017"

"It's very rare that I give 5 stars so this place is great.  The customer service was phenomenal.  Each and every bite of food was great and perfectly seasoned (except I didn't try the chicken, pork chops or sausages). I came for beef and BEEF is what I got.  My drink was perfect the first time around second time a lil too sweet but nether the less it was great atmosphere, great food and great service.

"This review is based on their customer service and they definitely deserve acknowledgment. Came in for NYC Restaurant week with a crew of 15. Unfortunately, because of restaurant week I couldn't book a party of 15 and had to make 2 separate reservations. When I got there I knew FOR SURE that both tables couldn't be by each other, but hey, what's there to lose? I asked anyway and they gave me the usual ""It's really busy tonight, but we'll try."" Understood. What I wasn't expecting was that they were able to put the tables together so that we could all sit together. They even accommodated us MORE by expanding the tables when one more person came. The waiters and management were super nice and very accommodating. Did not expect this at all since it was Restaurant Week. Food was amazing, of course!",5.0,"Aug 8, 2014"

This place is unbelievable. Prepare yourself before coming to eat here. They have a great salad bar to start off with but it's all about the meat here. They serve about 9-10 different types of meats to your table in rotation just slicing what you'd like right onto your plate. Like I said. Unbelievably incredible how delicious these meats are. Some of my favs were the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the parmesan encrusted pork. Wow I'm watering up just typing this. The sides they serve are pretty good too. I liked the mashed potatoes alot but those meats tho...omg. can't wait to go back again soon,5.0,"Jun 3, 2014"
"CHEAP WITH MEAT and with a HIGHER PRICE TAG ($10 more) THAN ANY OTHER Fogo de Chao LOCATION.Let me start by saying that I have been to many Fogo De Chao's locations - Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas - and that this is my first review ever. CONSISTENTLY, these other locations exceeded my expectations every time. That's why I was very excited to bring my NY girlfriend here to the NY location, but we were both SO DISAPPOINTED. The NY location not only charges about $10 (that is $59.99pp) more than any of the other locations I've been to, I also got the sense that they were trying to ""save"" on everything, especially the meats. I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN.Read the MEATS section.APPETIZERS: I waited 15 minutes for the first refill of the cheesy bread, and I asked 3 times for it, until I finally got it. I mean come on? It's bread.SALADS: Overall the salad bar was good, but not as good like the other locations. The fresh mozzarella wasn't the same quality like the other places, and the rice wasn't refilled for at least an hour, and my girlfriend really wanted rice. We had to ask to get it refilled.MEATS: In every other location you are given a large plate for the meats (""a fresh clean plate"") once you are done with the salad bar. Our waitress gave us, and I quote, ""a side plate"" for the meat, which must have been 5-6"" in diameter, or half the size of any normal main course plate. I have never been given an appetizer plate when I ordered steak in any other steakhouse or in any other Fogo de Chao location. Before the meats came, we told the head waitress we wanted well-done cuts at our table, and after she said she will take care of it, all meats that came were rare. So we literally ended up telling many times to each and every meat server that came to our table that we only wanted well done for our table. Considering that eating raw meat is ""at your own risk"", I felt that it was inappropriate for the staff to almost ""ignore"" our wishes and in an indirect way force us to eat raw meat. Then I began to wonder about the lamb chops and the rib eye cuts - these are arguably some of the better meats served. They never came. Instead we were offered chicken legs, sausage, sirloin, more chicken legs, more sirloin. After 15 minutes I began asking for the lamb chops and rib eye. At first they told me they don't even have rib eye, and then I said your website says you do, so I felt they were angry about it. We waited a long time, I think maybe another 20 minutes, until the lamb chops came well done, which was fine since we understood well done takes time. The only problem was we got one and half lamb chops between the both of us! UNACCEPTABLE. Now I'm going to have to wait for another 20 minutes if I want another lamb chop? I mean was this a game or something? I had to continuously ask for what I wanted and I was annoyed. After another 20 minutes came my rib eye, 3 small rectangles (1""X2""), which was perfect, except the meat server wanted to give me one. I was waiting for like 40 minutes for it, so I asked if the others were also well done, and when the meat server said yes, I said then give me all the 3 pieces. I didn't want to wait another 40 minutes. Reluctantly he did. For $59.99pp, this behavior is UNACCEPTABLE. I wish I was exaggerating.CONCLUSION. NEVER will I go again to Fogo de Chao in NY, and after this experience I will rethink about visiting this chain in other locations. Perhaps the once great Fogo de Chao is slipping.",2.0,"Sep 27, 2015"

"First let me say I have Celiac Disease and must eat gluten free. There were only three items out of over 40 (?) in the ""salad bar"" and the meats that I could not eat. The staff were all well advised. There is truly something for everyone here. The meats were literally amazing. It seems silly to call the salad bar that because there was such an amazing variety, down to little pickled red peppers we've never tried before, cold thinly sliced meats, caviar, more than ten salads, rice, and a soup of the day, Asparagus today. The service team was phenomenal. Handicapped accessible bathrooms and an elevator to the dining floor. Exquisite fresh floral decor. A few suggestions: make a reservation more than two days in advance for a weekend and allow for a full two hours for this dining experience. Lastly, may I say, i am not easily impressed by a restaurant. This was over $60 per person for the full churrasco experience and well worth it. That being said, $60 per person is not anywhere my usual budget. You might try a weekday lunch for a less expensive version. Interesting cocktails, too. I can't comment on dessert because we were replete without it.",5.0,"Jun 19, 2016"

We were lucky enough to get street parking right in front of the building. The seating is spacious and you're not crammed next to other patrons. The service was very professional and courteous and will get you whatever you need. They have an amazing salad bar. My favorite cut was the filet mignon wrapped in bacon. My fiancé and I split the chocolate cake, which was also delicious. You will want to walk off your meal after eating here, so stroll over to Times Square and be a true tourist. Also, the MoMA is right across the street.I feel we got an excellent value for the price. My only complaint was that there was a screaming baby on the other side of the room. It didn't bother us because we were far away, but I would have been upset if we were seated next to that party. This isn't a place to take kids. I would suggest that parents be respectful of other diners and hire a babysitter for the evening when eating here.",5.0,"Jan 24, 2015"

"I'm really sad to write this because I'm a huge fan of Fogo, I always try to visit the different Fogo's in different cities so while in NYC for a layover I stopped in for dinner. I ordered my usual glass of wine, they weren't sure if they had it so they went to check, I asked for an Iced Tea just in case. I never got a response if they had the wine or not and I never got my iced tea. All their meats seemed to be over cooked and not seasoned as normal. Also, we were never given fresh bread when we asked. Lastly, we asked for the bill and had to ask several waiters until someone brought it. We gave the waiter our credit card as he gave us the bill and he left and proceeded to clean a table, we finally got our receipt 10 minutes later. They seemed very disorganized and did not communicate with each other. It's a shame because in the time it took for them to get us our bill the table next to us ordered coffee and dessert and got it before we even got our bill.",2.0,"Jul 17, 2016"

"Fogo de Chao ruined my wedding dinner.  We booked a private dining room for 30 people and pre-contract the wine selection and service for our wedding party.  Fogo staff told us they weren't aware of our contract details.  They screwed most of our wedding dinner up with their poor service, not providing our pre-selected wine, failing to provide the 3 pre-ordered fish dishes for the vegetarians, and argued with us while I (Bride) was in tears about all of this in front of our guests.  Debbie the Manager assured me for 3 months that she has 20 years of experience in event planning and everything will go smoothly.  Well Debbie, IT DIDN'T!!!!  We were embarrassed by Fogo staff in front of our guests and it ruined our wedding dinner.  I can't shake off how Fogo ruined my special day and argued with us in front of our guests.  I've tried to shake it off, but it stuck with me right through my honeymoon and now I just feel sad when I look back at my wedding dinner pictures.  This will stay with me forever and Fogo now acts like they could care less.  They even added insult to injury by offering us a gift certificate.  Why would I EVER want to eat in the place that makes me cry from a ruined wedding dinner??  Don't trust Fogo with a special celebration.  They don't care about your special day and will just embarrass you and insult you in the process.",1.0,"May 9, 2015"
"After trying Brazilian steak previously in midtown I figured restaurant week was the perfect excuse to give it another go here. With a $20 dollar discount I came in with my twin and 2 friends and we were seated within 15 minutes. You are taken down a long spiral staircase where you pass a large buffett area and a plethora of seating. Quickly after seating we were given little placeholders to flip green if we wanted food or red to stop. After sampling the buffet which had some nice veggies and cheeses, I sat ready for the main attraction the meat. The food was solid but not amazing. I liked the chicken legs wrapped in bacon and the skirt steak. Their house specialty was OK and some of their other cuts of meat were a bit on the pinker side when I had hoped for medium. The service was exceptional however, your plate was empty for maybe 30 seconds before more meat was offered and they constantly came around asking if you wanted something to drink or remove a plate that had enough food on it before to give you a new one. The desert I ordered was the chocolate mousse and it was really great. Overall, this was a successful and fun dinner, I dont know if I'd come back at full price here but if someone is really craving brazillian steak I know where to turn.",4.0,"Mar 8, 2015"
"This place was so fun. Very different from your typical dining experience. The salad bar was over the top for this paleo girl. My head was about to explode. It was like opening my refrigerator.

"All you can eat Brazilian style meat served by ""authentic"" Brazilian cowboys. This is a chain restaurant, but the concept is great, specially if you are feeling like devouring pounds and pounds of meat! The prices are OK, very reasonable for lunch during the week. Everything outside the buffet menu is a little pricier, such as drinks and desserts. I was very impressed by their wine list, they offer a great variety of red wines from Europe and America, that go extremely well with the meat. The only problem is that they don't seem to have a sommelier, with such a large wine list this would make sense. Other than that, the service is very good, over attentive waiter comes around a bit too much for my taste. Fogo is a consistently good Brazilian Currasqueria, where you know every time you go you are going to get tasty meat, and good service.",4.0,"Mar 17, 2014"

Very different from Plataforma, for example, where there are dozens of them offering various cuts of meat.Buffet much inferior to Plataforma again, with a much more limited choice, and especially no shrimp or maki rolls.When we first sat down (3 people), before we started eating, the manager came and offered to buy us the first drink if we moved to another table so they could seat 5 people. I ordered one glass of wine, not the most expensive one, but sure enough, at the end of the meal, I had to ask the waiter as the drink was on the tab...For the same price, Plataforma is a much better choice.

"I went to this place yesterday for the first time and I must say that from the outside looking in, this place is very impressive. So we celebrated my birthday and traditionally (past 5 years) we would go to Plataforma Churrascaria on 49th, however I saw this place and decided to give it a try. The reservation was made for 6, but when we got there we had three more friends who surprised me which made that now a party of 9. The Manager and greeter both refused to seat us at a larger table and when asked to utilize a table in the back that was not being used I was told it was for a party of 20, who apparently did not show up because we were there from 8 till 10:45. The person serving us (Christiana) service was horrible and we went long periods of time (10-12 mins) without anyone coming over to us serving meat. I had to apologize to my family & friends because we would not habe gotten such a lousy service at Plataforma. The mood there is always upbeat and everyone has a smile and make sure the customers are doing well. The money that was paid here was definitely not worth the service that was given. I honestly feel cheated and would not return to this Brazilian Steakhouse. Not everyone's experience will be the same, but I am just sharing my experience. At the end of the night, the server was give the check and she made a face when the bill was being split with cash & card. Then the manager comes over to the table just to give the receipts to another server to give to us. Really??? Are you too exclusive to interact with the guests?

"I had very high expectations for this restaurant and they certainly did not disappoint! Came here for restaurant week and had such an amazing dining experience. They have a very spacious and open waiting area located upstairs where you can sit until the rest of your party arrives; they don't seat you until everyone is present. Our waiter was very polite and fun. So right after you're seated they give each person at the table a coaster, one side is green and the other is red. The idea is that you flip to the green when you want the servers to come by to carve and serve you whatever meat they present to you. There are always multiple servers on the floor so make sure you're ready to eat! When you feel like taking a break you flip your coaster back to the red side so they know to skip over your table. What a cute idea! My favorite from everything I tried was the top sirloin. The chicken breast with bacon was a bit too dry for my tastes but everything else was great. They have a variety of lamb, pork, chicken and steak. Also there's an open salad bar you can go to as many times as you'd like. Along with the meats, they also come to give you plantains, mashed potato and another small dish that they constantly refill for you. How awesome is that? Service here is fantastic.

This place has great ambiance, and the multilevel structure is nice on the eyes.That said, I am filing a 2 star review because of the food and drink problems. One caveat: I ordered from the bar menu, so I don't expect the quality to be as high as the regular menu.Food: I chose the ""filet mignon."" It came back looking like two under cooked hamburger patties. I wish I had taken a picture to illustrate this ghastly situation. As far as I know, filet mignon is one round piece of steak, not two burgers that look like they were prepared in the cafeteria at IKEA. It was frankly quite unappetizing. Moreover, it was $20! If I am going to pay $20 for a mini-filet mignon, I at least want it to look, taste, and be cooked like a filet mignon. Speaking of the cooking, they asked me when I ordered to specify how I wanted it cooked. I said medium. Whether it was really cooked medium or not is essentially moot, as a one inch thickness in a steak can sort of be cooked in any way and you can't really tell.Drinks: Not as big of a problem here, although they did not have in stock my first three choices. They didn't have Amstel Lite, Xingu Gold, and Stella Artois. Last I checked, bars stored the beers they advertised on their menu. Perhaps things have changed.",2.0,"Jun 11, 2014"

"If you want to finish your dinner being physically harassed ending with a 911 call and police showing up while management exemplifies what it means to be incompetent, then Fogo de Chao is the place to go too. After a lovely dinner with my 10 week pregnant girlfriend, we went upstairs to get our coats only to be approached by a man who put his hands on my girlfriend and then slapped my ass. Clearly seeing he was intoxicated, I asked the lady at the front desk (who saw everything and asked if she could do something) to call security or management to have this man escorted out. The first manager came upstairs, looked at the situation then left because he didn't want to deal with it. The employee who got our jackets said out loud, ""are you kidding me?! Did he just come upstairs, see what's going on only to leave?"" Then matters escalated as this intoxicated individual wanted to fight me. My pregnant girlfriend was getting scared, as one would expect, so I asked the employee at the desk to call 911. Finally two mangers came and had to ask the gentleman to leave. He would not leave and forced himself past the two mangers into my face and continued to try to fight me. I asked in a (forceful tone) if they would remove him from the restaurant after I heard a restaurant employee say he didn't even dine there, that he just walked in from the street. What shocked me was management let him berate my girlfriend and me with language I can not say on yelp while they did absolutely nothing about it. Finally after a few attempts of this intoxicating man trying to charge me, did they restrain him and took him outside. We waited while the police came and management did nothing to rectify the situation. They let the intoxicate man stay outside the restaurant (at one point giving the manager a hug and he actually hugged him back which shocked me because I'm just payed a $230 bill yet this guy gets special treatment with a hug). They let him stay outside the entire one so we had to wait for the police to arrive. Once the police arrive the man fled and the police even yelled at the two managers for their poor handling of the situation. If I spent $230 on dinner, i don't expect to be physically harassed and the WORST part was that management was aware and LET IT HAPPEN. This is completely unacceptable! This restaurant may have good food but once you pay they bill, they don't care because they have your knew abs will let a complete stranger harass you IN THEIR RESTAURANT  I'm assuming was all captured on their security cameras too.",1.0,"Mar 17, 2018"
"Quick overview : -Pros: delicious and authentic rodizio experience, friendly gauchos (waiters), good bang for your buck-Cons: relatively high concentration of tourists, poor reservations/patron inflow systemDetails on each:Pros: -SALAD BAR -  The highlights are the palmito (heart of palm, looks like fat white asparagus cuts), shitake mushrooms (large and flavorful), and the feijoado (rice and beans). I know some may say it's a waste of valuable stomach space to fill up on veggies and carbs at an all-you-can-eat steakhouse, but I've done this a few times, and personally, I've found that you have to play the long game - over the course of a few hours, my body is able to take in a lot more meat if I've given it a bit of variety/balance with the other food groups as well.  -MEATS - The quality of the meat is fantastic. That means that most cuts have just some salt on them and the flavor/quality of the meat will speak for itself. The highlights here are the house specialty (picanha), filet mignon, and the garlic sirloin. Less awesome ones were the ribs and the chicken (still good, but ration that stomach space!). If it's your first time here, I recommend asking for a small piece of everything that comes through the first time, hone in on your favorites, and load up on those the 2nd, 3rd, and yes, 4th, times that they come around. You can flag down gauchos to inquire about a specific cut if you haven't seen it circulating the room in a while. -SERVICE -  Flawless. Friendly, prompt, responsive. Couldn't ask for anything more or anything less. This is what service is supposed to be about - helping you enjoy your meal more without overpowering the experience. -COST - I think dinner was $60pp. Yes, I know, it's not the cheapest place to eat steak. But, I think for the variety, quality, and sheer quantity of what you get, there's not a better deal, especially in NYC. Cons:-LOTS OF TOURISTS - I actually don't mind tourists , but for people who do, I'll flag this for you. I would say on a Saturday night, at least half of the people there looked like they were from out-of-town (don't pretend like you can't recognize them immediately). -CROWD CONTROL - Made reservations for 8pm, seated at 845pm. No one apologized. What's the point of taking reservations if you blow right through them? Management should probably rethink the time they allot to each table. I would not have minded accepting a later reservation if it meant I would wait for less time. Also, this meant that you could see hunks of delicious steak circling the room, only to be all gone by the time it reached you :( This happened to us a few times, though we eventually got all the cuts we wanted. This might be purposeful/never change though, since I think it's in the restaurant's economic interest to make you eat slowly so your body gets full. OVERALL: I would (and probably will) go again, but only on a weeknight when it's probably less crowded.Random tip: wear something with some stretch. The dress code is not that formal here so for girls, i would suggest a loose skirt with some elastic in it, and guys, looser pants with an adjustable belt.",4.0,"Jun 27, 2014"

"I dream about this place. I've travelled around the world and eaten in many steakhouses and this is the best steak I've ever eaten. If you look at places like Ruth Chris where a tiny steak is $45, then this price is reasonable for the amount and quality of food. The seasoning is superb. The atmosphere is elegant and chic. The cheese bread is to die for and so are the plantains dipped in rum. Salad bar is fresh and has good choices. I've gone to the Beverly Hills, Philadelphia, and Manhattan location and have never been disappointed. Excellent service and delicious food.",5.0,"Feb 18, 2016"
"OK, so...just yesterday I went to this restaurant for the first time, and it will be my last time at not only this place but at ANY Brazilian steakhouse. I understand that Fogo is one of the better known, upscale chains in the Brazialian steakhouse sector. If that is the case and the dinner I just had was supposed to be one of the better renditions of it, then it was HIGHLY disappointing. Unlimited portions of gamy, TOUGH meats for $60? No thank you!

"Holy walking spears of heart attack! We had an amazing night here with another couple over the summer. The restaurant is really swanky inside and welcoming. The service is truly great with water refilled and dishes promptly taken. The selection of meats is endless and the salad bar isn't just some plain old salad bar you would find at say Sizzlers! Everything is fresh and looks delicious that it was seriously hard to only take a bite or two of things that were offered to leave more room for glorious steak. The sides that they give you at the table are great and I could not stop eating the fried sweet plantains - thank god those were endless as well because I pretty much finished the first plate without anyone else getting a taste. What added even more to this was we came during Restaurant Week when the prices were much lower then normal - SO worth it that we will do it again next time the ""Week"" rolls around!",4.0,"Oct 28, 2014"
"Very good steakhouse, the space is amazing. They made a beautiful restaurant. They have a salad table which has a huge variety of salads and another appetizers. The pão de queijo (cheese bread) is the best and the polenta as well. However, I was expecting more of the meat because usually the Brazilian steakhouses that have such high prices have a huge variety of meats which they did not have. That is why I rated them with four stars. But, if you have some extra money and want to have a good meal with someone especial you should definitely go there.",4.0,"Dec 21, 2015"
"Pleasantly surprised when I heard one of my old time faves opened up in the city adding another Brazilian churascarria. The first thing I noticed is the space is very large. The dining area is in the lower level basement but because of the setup (there is no 1st floor really) the effect is of soaring ceilings and the feeling that you're in a cathedral of a dining room, a rarity in NYC where you're often sitting elbow to elbow in a crowded tiny dining room. The food was as good as I remembered it with helpful and polite servers ready to throw a myriad of beef pork and chicken your way. As usually I stayed away from the lesser cuts of pork and chicken and stuck with the filet and garlic picanha. Picanha is the must have as it epitomizes what Brazilian bbq is. It's popular in Brazil and arguably the signature cut here despite it being what I recall is just a rump roast. But it's pretty damn tasty. With all that meat in my belly I had to head to the salad bar (yes I did) for a plate of greens to make sure I was at least keeping to a balanced diet :)",4.0,"Apr 26, 2015"

"My friend and i decided to take advantage of the restaurant week deal and give this place a try, and we could not have chosen a better place! I was so pleasantly surprised at the amount and quality of food offered to us. The only difference between restaurant week and regular dining was that restaurant week customers did not get offered certain kinds of meats. Fine by me! The 11 different kinds that we were offered still exceeded our expectations. How they are able to make chicken breast so juicy will be forever a mystery to me. The unlimited salad bar had more than just simple fresh greens; there was a variety of cheeses, prosciutto and other hams, smoked salmon, white rice, beans, and so, so many more. In addition, each table gets 3 free sides - plantains, mashed potatoes, and polenta fries. Needless to say, i was barely able to sit straight by the end of the meal. Ill definitely be returning to this place in the future even without the restaurant week advantage.",5.0,"Feb 21, 2015"
"Heard great things about this place.  My family was so excited.  Two of us did say the potato salad was great.  One of us thought the meat was good.  I really felt like it was very average.  I could have gotten those meats at Applebee's or something and saved a TON of money (even though it was restaurant week).  They didn't offer us a menu for drinks, but did ask if anyone wanted anything besides water to drink.  My husband and kids got sodas.  We found out when we received the bill they charge per drink they bring you.  I don't have a problem with that, but they should have told us or offered a menu for us to see it.  We talked to the manager on duty that evening.  We told her we felt like it was just pretty average and about the issue with the drinks.  She couldn't have cared less.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!

"Big mistakeSo, my wife and I frequent this restaurant quite often mainly because the meat is cooked tastefully, lots of food varieties and with mediocre service. However I never thought that we would be offered such subpar service at a restaurant in a busy nyc area where people are paying over $160 for two each evening. This was a monday night.  After we were seated, 5 mins passed and we were not greeted at the table until one passing waiter saw our faces and decided to ask if we wanted something? (Mind you, we never saw this waiter again for the rest of the evening). We ordered our drinks and got up to the dinner buffet for salads, bread, rice and beans. To our surprise, over 10 spots were left empty as we waited around for bread and veggies to be replenished, which never happened until we decided to complain after visiting the buffet 4 times. Once we sat down with our food, we waited not less than 20 minutes until we finally were able to get a waiters attention. We asked for the manager and the waiter stood staring as it was out of the norm. The manager then came 10mins later and we expressed how we are loyal guests and continue our loyalty due to multiple reasons, one of which we thought was their service. We mentioned that we had not received any service all evening, no one bothered to ask if our meals were pleasant or if we needed anything else (which we needed straws) and items were not replaced on the bar after waiting for awhile. She stated, I will talk to my staff, brought a saucer of bread and walked away. When it was time for us to begin our meat service, we waited around for our three dishes: plantains corn meal and mashed potatoes. We were told, the mashed potatoes were coming, and they are still coming but somehow never made it to our table all night. Again we had to get some passerby waiter to get us another drink. As for the meats, we waited around 10 mins each time after a guy stopped to give us some meat until another came around with the same thing. After mentioning the way we liked our meat cooked, no one bothered to even come once to our table with varieties, instead meat close to being raw and bloody was brought to us, the same cuts. We walked out very unhappy and will not be giving our business to this fogo de chao again mainly because after we repeatedly, and politely expressed our concerns, we were not waited on properly and items were overlooked just because we were not a party of 5 or more. It is not my concern that they were busy. They were not up to full capacity, yet were not able to wait on a table of two for petty things like food items straws mashed potatoes and drinks, all which were reasonable requests. Id prefer to go to another steakhouse that appreciates my loyalty instead of just saying they will talk to their staff! I would not recommend this location on 53rd st to anyone who is looking for any sort of proper service or the bare essentials on the food bar. Rakesh Singh312-802-0387",1.0,"Aug 1, 2014"

"I've been to a few different locations so when I heard there was a new Fogo in NYC i was excited, I went during Restraunt week and the service was so ridiculous. I brought my boyfriends parents there and it was like no one knew what they where doing. First they sat us all the way in the back....and just left us there! no one brought us water, told us they where our server, gave us the spiel on how the meat cards work or to go up to the salad bar. We sat there neglected for about 15 mins until out of frustration we literally grabbed a server by the arm and demanded attention. She rolled her eyes at us (which is fine because we touched her arm and maybe shouldn't have) but then all she told us was that we could go to the salad bar. When we came back to our seats with salad bar food another waiter came and asked us if anyone was waiting on us, when we said no she tried to play it off like someone else must have forgot to come to us, when we where obviously sitting in our section. not to mention she dropped our dishes on the floor once.

We were quickly seated, which was great because even when we've had reservations some places make us wait. Their service was almost flawless, except for the tab...but I suppose nothing is perfect? They split the tab wrong, so we were charged a faulty amount once, and then they had to reverse that transaction and charge our cards a second time for the correct amount..........argh.(4/5)We were seated downstairs in one of the private rooms.The decor is very nice, I felt like I was in a very exclusive restaurant...not a buffet. (5/5) They have a veggie buffet, which is nice but don't get full on that because the protein is what you're paying for. I enjoy LEAN cuts of meat, therein lies the problem with this place. In order for me to eat every piece they put on my plate....I had to do the trimming. That got very annoying because their cuts of meat have a lot of fat. My friends loved it, but my friends aren't as picky about their diet as I am. (1/5)I suppose people who go to buffets don't pay much attention to their diet, but their fatty meats is why I gave this place a 1 star rating.

The sausage was not good quality. They didn't take plates away like in every other churrascaria. The final blow was when they reported to open table that we didn't show up when unfourtanately we did.

"Came here with family who had previously been to the location in Indianapolis. It does seem expensive, but it is definitely worth it. The salad bar is large and impressive, and was fresh. The seemingly endless supply of different meats were really, really good (the chicken and lamb were delicious). There is no dedicated server for your table, rather, the whole staff waits on you. If there is a particular item you're interested in, you can simply tell a waiter and  they will make sure that item is sent to you ASAP. For instance, my table wanted to try the lamb but it wasn't making it rounds. We told an employee, and a few minutes later, there is was. The gluten free rolls were buttery and delicious. Desserts were a tad too large, but also super good. I had the papaya cream thing a waiter recommended, and I tried a bite of the towering chocolate mouse. The chocolate mouse cake was too sweet for my tastebuds, but the papaya cream was amazing. Nice and light, which was good seeing as how you will definitely overeat beforehand since everything is so tasty.I think its important to note that the servers who walk around with the meat have different pieces cooked to different temperatures (rare, medium rare, medium well, etc.). I hope there is a Groupon or LivingSocial deal at some point in the future, because this place is fantastic (albeit expensive).",5.0,"Dec 22, 2013"

"My boyfriend is from Brasil and I wanted to surprise him for his birthday by bringing him to a Brasilian steakhouse. He had been homesick recently since he couldn't go back home for the holidays and I thought this would cheer him up. I made the mistake of scheduling our meal for dinner time. I had no idea that traditional Rodizio was a lunch affair. Despite my mistake, my boyfriend was a perfect gentleman. He claimed that the food was overpriced for what it was, and the ambiance was a bit gaudy, but overall we had a generally fine experience. We wouldn't go back, but it wasn't terrible. The main reason I wouldn't go back is because I had a sense that some of the staff were uncomfortable with some of our PDA, and that spoiled our evening a little. When they brought out the birthday cake, I kissed his fuzzy brown head and told him I loved him. I could feel the judgment from the eyes of the staff when this happened.

Most people are familiar with the churrascaria approach.  A green puck says feed me and red says stop and thus reduces the consumption of red meat to its most binary state possible with the fewest trappings of interaction possible.  The setting is large and densely packed.  Meat ain't cheap nor is being MoMA's neighbor.  Service is more efficient than passionate.

"I was a huge fan of brazilian bbq until this place gave me a horrible case of food poisoning. You know the kind where you're shitting your asshole out while simultaneously throwing up the entire contents of your stomach all while you have abdominal pains so bad you think you're insides are going to explode (good times!). And the 10 feet from my bed to the toilet was too far of a distance to handle that I slept on the bathroom floor even though it smelled like a shit vomit bomb had exploded in the air. I'm still too traumatized from eating at fogo de chao to go out for brazilian bbq again (certainly won't be frequenting this particular chain ever again). The next day I called to speak with a manager to report the food poisoning and both the hostess that answered the phone and the manager I spoke with were unempathetic. If a customer calls and said they got food poisoning after eating at your restaurant the next words out of your mouth should be ""i'm very sorry to hear that."" That's not the kind of customer service I received when I called. I was told my meal would be refunded... THAT never happened even after multiple calls to follow-up on said refund.

"Meatgasm time;decadent and sensual...there is no dining experience I enjoy more than putting succulent,tender,juicy,bloddy pieces of beef and lamb into my mouth again and again and again,all the while sheltered in the love of the one who made it possible.     I adore bloody rare meat and I got it,served by attentive,usually smiling,Gauchos with stellar knife skills.If I asked for rarer pieces or a cut I'd missed they ran and got it for me.My idea of paradise.     Extremely attentive service by all.Initially was off-putting(hovering too close)when there were only three occupied tables.As the room filled,everyone hit their seamless stride,providing outstanding unobtrusive service.     Concentrate on delectable Picanha,Filet Mignon,and Lamb(rib chops and leg of lamb).Avoid dry chicken legs and pork ribs.     All of the meats(less so the lamb) were salty-as-fuck.I suppose if you're having fruity drinks/wine or eating mounds of white rice,a balance would be achieved.     The restrooms were fine contrary to some other reviews that had me concerned.They are located on both the street and lower levels.     We had  reservations for the start of dinner service.We were given a beeper and made to wait while two parties of walk-ins were seated.Uncalled for bs on a Monday at 5:30pm!We purposely wanted to avoid tourists,crowds,a scene,and enjoy our meatfest.The room eventually got pretty full for a Monday evening.     Upon being seated,we were offered the options of sparkling or bottled water,which was served without ice.Only after we had ordered,did a server appear on the floor with a pitcher of cold tap water.     Some observations:Rodizio is inherently paleo nirvana.:Fogo is ""family-friendly""(read screaming monster alert).The salad bar is International/allover the place,not strictly Brazilian.I did get my palmitos(hearts of palm)and tomatoes,but there was neither watercress nor couve(kale).The complimentary sides while continuously replenished,were never hot.Mashed potatoes were instant.Drinks were very good.Dessert okay(Papaya cream thing)but irrelevant.     I am giving Fogo 5 stars.Not flawless,but I would ,and will,go back in a heartbeat.",5.0,"Jul 2, 2014"
"We went here for Restaurant Week, which is a tremendous deal -- $38 for all you can eat meat, salad bar, and sides? Insane. Definitely worth it. The place was packed when we went and our table was a little awkwardly located, but it was fine. We didn't spend long at the salad bar (why waste your appetite on anything but the meat, really?) but I enjoyed what I got. The RW menu took away what are perhaps the ""choicest"" cuts of meat (I think we had 8 options instead of 10? Something like that), but it's hard to notice. There's so much variety and all of the stuff comes very quickly. I will say the chicken they serve is rather dry -- I briefly choked on a piece -- so maybe stick with the red meats. The sides and bread are also delicious, and the RW menu even came with dessert. I couldn't imagine eating another bite, but I managed to enjoy the frosting on my slice of chocolate cake. Overall, very delicious! The main drawback is probably just how crammed in all the tables are.",4.0,"Mar 15, 2015"
"Wow - that was hands down one of the top five meals I've ever had. My fiance and I were lucky enough to snag a reservation to Fogo de Chao for Valentine's Day, and I was so blown away by the experience that I'm already asking to go back. Just like other reviewer's have said, the service is impeccable (though not as overbearing as some have experienced). Our server was helpful in tracking down meats that we hadn't gotten to try yet (fiance was dying to try the leg of lamb) and answer questions, but generally just let us savor the insane amounts of meat being offered to us. My favorite was the bottom sirloin; the bacon wrapped chicken I was excited to try was totally underwhelming. The pao de queso was great; the other sides sufficient but not really worth the stomach room when there was so much awesome meat to have instead. Two important things: 1. Its totally worth skipping lunch before going here, to have maximum stomach room available. You'll need it. 2. Eat the meat as offered to you, and then turn your card to green. Its best when its still steaming off the stick. so as tempting as it is to let it pile up on your plate, turn your card to red until you can inhale what you have in front of you.",5.0,"Feb 19, 2014"

"I recently went for lunch with my husband for our anniversary and it was all around amazing! The food, service, and decor were all beautiful. Roger was our server and he was awesome. All of the other servers and support staff were great. Everyone seemed interested in the quality of our experience. We have been to other Fogo de Chao restaurants and several other Brazilian steakhouses. The main difference with Fogo de Chao is that they have many delicious cuts of meat, and not just one or two good ones like at many other Churrascarias. They also serve their full service of meats for lunch and dinner. That was what made us choose them over the others. They gave us a beautiful complimentary dessert for our anniversary, and that was really sweet. We particularly enjoyed the lamb chops and the sirloin. We wish it was easier to differentiate between all the different malbecs, the menu could do with a few more full bodied cabernets to choose from. One would be wise to disregard any negative reviews during restaurant week. That is not a normal circumstance for any restaurant. Thanks for a great meal and anniversary!",5.0,"Mar 16, 2015"
"This place is amazing - wonderful ambiance, wonderful scenery and decor, very friendly and inviting staff and an awesome and superb Customer Specialist whose name is Victor. He came around personally to check on me and my date, engaged us in friendly conversation, and even asked us if there were additional meats we'd like to try and how well cooked we'd want it - within minutes we had various meats with different cooked temperatures.  Victor's presence and service made the dining experience THAT much better. The drinks were great too. The salad and sides bar is unlimited with various options to go with your meats. The sweet and caramelized bananas were amazing and they replenished us with many servings. Servers are very attentive - my water was always filled, many sorts of meats were offered and those servers came around often, and the moment was cocktail was finished, I was immediately offered another round, which also came out quickly. The key-lime pie is delicious and recommended. This great restaurant participated in restaurant week and is a gem. I highly suggest this gem to everyone and for all occasions.",5.0,"Mar 6, 2015"
"family and I went to fogo de chao for birthday celebrations and to see what all the fuss was about. needless to say, we got what we expected, sort of. decor and  service were great, hence the 4 stars. food was only ok, hence minus 1 star.  as frequent patrons of AYCE and steak houses, our party has high food expectations generally. we LOVE the ""other"" AYCE brazilian steakhouse nearby and the sister restaurant that closed last year *sad*. here is where fogo's food went wrong when compared. buffet was slightly lacking. yeah they had the different salads and cold appetizers but somehow they were uninspired and lacked the variety of the other's salad bar. also fogo only seemed to have 3/4 the variety of cold dishes which meant I didn't find everything I was looking for but I still managed to get some greens and beets onto my plate. as for the side dishes that come with the meal, this was also lacking. the fried sweet banana and warm doughy cheese bread was good but the fried polenta were like pieces of very hard bricks that no one touched. picky picky, and I know the reason to come to a place such as this is for the meats, but even the meats we found a bit uninspired. the lamb and beef ribs were very good but the other cuts of beef were under seasoned and lacked that melt in your mouth quality. as usual, since this happens everywhere, the chicken was dry as was the pork lion (especially without the pineapple sauce the ""other"" place has), but the sausage was good and so was the bacon wrapped meat(i forget what it was exactly). as for the top and bottom sirloin cuts and the ribeye, even though slightly over cooked and under seasoned the quality if the meat still shined through, so save room for seconds and thirds. lastly, the signature cocktails and wines were good and desserts of creme brûlée, flan, and key lime pie were an ok end to an ok meal.maybe they were having an off day with the meats and salad bar selection so we will be back fogo de chao, don't you worry.",4.0,"Mar 23, 2014"
